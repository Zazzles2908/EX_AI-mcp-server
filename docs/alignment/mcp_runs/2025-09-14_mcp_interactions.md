# EXAI MCP Call Interactions – 2025-09-14

This document logs three sequential EXAI MCP calls after the server restart, with concise conclusions, artifacts, and an overall assessment of functionality.

## MCP Call 1 – Status Snapshot
- Kind: status_exai-mcp (hub=true, include_tools=true)
- Result: SUCCESS
- Provider: N/A (diagnostic)
- Model: N/A
- Estimated Cost: $0.00
- Duration: not recorded by tool (fast)
- Summary:
  - Providers configured: GLM, KIMI
  - Models available (sample): glm-4.5, glm-4.5-flash, kimi-k2-0711-preview, kimi-k2-0905, moonshot variants
  - Tools loaded: analyze, challenge, chat, codereview, debug, kimi_multi_file_chat, planner, refactor, status, testgen, thinkdeep
  - Recent context optimizer entries show no errors

Raw key fields captured:
- providers_configured: ["ProviderType.GLM", "ProviderType.KIMI"]
- tools_loaded: ["analyze", "challenge", "chat", "codereview", "debug", "kimi_multi_file_chat", "planner", "refactor", "status", "testgen", "thinkdeep"]

## MCP Call 2 – Low-token QA (Project-specific)
- Kind: chat_exai-mcp (glm-4.5-flash)
- Prompt: List active tool shims (src.tools.*) and confirm staged/inactive Option B shim
- Files attached: tools/registry.py, src/tools/chat.py, src/tools/planner.py, src/tools/debug.py, docs/alignment/phaseC/ENTRYPOINTS_AND_TOOLS_MIGRATION.md, docs/alignment/phaseB/OPTION_B_SHIM_NOTES.md, providers/registry_srcshim.py
- Result: ERROR
- Error: UnboundLocalError: "cannot access local variable 'TextContent' where it is not associated with a value" (daemon)
- Estimated Cost: N/A (no model inference completed)
- Duration: not recorded (failed early)
- Notes: Likely a tool wrapper scoping bug in the MCP layer using TextContent within a local scope; requires a small code fix.

## MCP Call 3 – Deeper QA (More tokens)
- Kind: chat_exai-mcp (glm-4.5-flash)
- Prompt: Deeper QA on Phase B (Option A active; Option B staged), legacy imports to migrate, risks, and one-sentence recommendation
- Files attached: tools/consensus.py, tools/registry.py, providers/__init__.py, docs/alignment/phaseB/OPTION_B_SHIM_NOTES.md, src/providers/registry.py
- Result: ERROR (same daemon error as Call 2)
- Estimated Cost: N/A (no model inference completed)
- Duration: not recorded (failed early)

## Overall Functionality – Summary, Pros and Cons

### Summary
- Status/hub diagnostics are functioning and reflect the current consolidated setup: GLM and KIMI present; key tools loaded; no critical errors in recent optimization logs.
- Chat-based QA calls failed due to a local-scoping bug referencing TextContent in the MCP tool layer; this blocks interactive QA until patched.

### Pros
- Providers configured and discoverable (GLM, KIMI)
- Tool registry reflects new shims: chat, planner, debug under src.tools.* while retaining behavior
- Staged Provider Option B shim documented and ready (providers/registry_srcshim.py)
- Status/hub flows are healthy, indicating overall server responsiveness

### Cons
- Chat tool path returns UnboundLocalError on TextContent – prevents QA runs
- Usage telemetry (cost, precise duration) not surfaced in tool responses yet
- Remaining legacy imports exist; Option B not yet activated (by design) – potential drift until flipped

### Why (root-cause/impact reasoning)
- The error indicates a Python scoping issue where TextContent is referenced before proper association in a local scope inside a tool wrapper – a minimal code fix. Until resolved, chat_exai-mcp calls cannot complete, blocking QA-style analyses despite the overall registry and provider readiness.

### Recommendation
- Apply a minimal MCP wrapper fix for TextContent scoping in the chat tool pipeline; then retry the QA calls (low-token and deeper). After chat path is green, proceed with a small PR to activate Option B shim in a controlled module (or alias import), eliminating provider registry duplication.



## Post-adjustment runs (after SimpleTool TextContent import hardening)

Note: Implemented a defensive change to avoid any possible local-scope import pitfalls by moving `from mcp.types import TextContent` to module scope in tools/simple/base.py. This should not alter behavior but reduces scoping risk paths.

### MCP Call A — Status snapshot (sanity)
- Result: YES
- Provider: N/A (diagnostic)
- Model: N/A
- Estimated Cost: $0.00
- Duration: ~fast
- Summary:
  - Providers configured: GLM, KIMI
  - Tools loaded include: analyze, chat, codereview, debug, planner, refactor, status, testgen, thinkdeep
  - Hub suggests primary routes healthy

### MCP Call B — Low-token QA (Analyze)
- Tool: analyze_exai-mcp (one-step)
- Result: YES
- Provider: N/A (analyze-only)
- Model: N/A
- Estimated Cost: $0.00
- Duration: ~fast
- Summary:
  - Shims active: chat/planner/debug map to src.tools.* (registry)
  - Option B provider shim present at providers/registry_srcshim.py (inactive by design)
  - Watch items: ensure telemetry surfacing for cost/duration; verify no legacy imports conflict in CI

### MCP Call C — Deeper QA (Analyze, higher thinking)
- Tool: analyze_exai-mcp (one-step, thinking_mode=high)
- Result: YES
- Provider: N/A (analyze-only)
- Model: N/A
- Estimated Cost: $0.00
- Duration: ~fast
- Summary:
  - Phase B risks: import drift, mixed registry paths, partial migrations causing subtle model selection issues
  - Rollout plan: (1) lock registry entrypoints; (2) flip Option B shim in a single pilot module; (3) CI guard: forbid old providers.* paths; (4) observability: capture provider/model per call
  - Guardrails: feature flag for fallback; revert plan documented; telemetry checks for null-response conditions

### MCP Call D — Low-token QA (Chat)
- Tool: chat_exai-mcp
- Result: ERROR
- Provider: GLM (requested model glm-4.5-flash)
- Model: glm-4.5-flash (requested)
- Estimated Cost: N/A (no inference)
- Duration: n/a
- Notes: Daemon error persists: "cannot access local variable 'TextContent' where it is not associated with a value". Likely wrapper-level scoping; repo-side SimpleTool hardened.

### MCP Call E — Deeper QA (Chat, higher thinking)
- Tool: chat_exai-mcp
- Result: ERROR
- Provider: GLM (requested model glm-4.5-flash)
- Model: glm-4.5-flash (requested)
- Estimated Cost: N/A (no inference)
- Duration: n/a
- Notes: Same daemon error as Call D.


## Adjustment 2 — Server-side TextContent scoping hardening (2025-09-15)

- Change: Removed per-call/local imports of TextContent inside the server request/response path and normalized all isinstance checks and constructions to use the module-scoped import.
- Files touched: server.py (boundary execution, auto-continue, and progress attachment blocks)
- Rationale: Prevent any chance of Python treating TextContent as a locally-bound name inside nested scopes, which can trigger UnboundLocalError in some wrapper/daemon exec paths.
- Expected behavior change: None functionally; safer import pattern only.

Next rerun plan after restart:
- Call F — Low-token QA (chat_exai-mcp): verify active src.tools shims and Option B shim status
- Call G — Deeper QA (chat_exai-mcp): Phase B consolidation risks, rollout steps, guardrails
