```md
## Summary in 5 bullets
- Comprehensive inventory of tools in EX-AI-MCP-Server with clear categorization into registered tools, internal modules, and likely-unused scripts
- Tools organized into subfolders (cost/, reasoning/, shared/, simple/, unified/, workflow/) alongside many top-level Python entry points
- Authoritative registration through tools/registry.py TOOL_MAP with server.py fallback static EXACT_TOOLSET
- Tools categorized as core utilities, provider-specific implementations, diagnostics/observability, and orchestrators/aliases
- Several unregistered utility scripts mixed with core tool implementations creating discoverability challenges

## Structural inconsistencies
1. **Mixed organization**: Top-level tool files coexist with subfolders, blurring lines between entry points and support modules
2. **Inconsistent categorization**: Provider-specific tools (kimi_*, glm_*) mixed with general-purpose tools without clear grouping
3. **Unclear registration status**: Files like selfcheck.py imported in tools/__init__.py but not mapped in TOOL_MAP
4. **No clear separation**: Diagnostic scripts and maintenance tools intermingled with core tool implementations
5. **Inconsistent naming**: Some files follow clear patterns (kimi_upload_and_extract) while others are generic (activity.py, status.py)

## 3 actionable fixes with rationale and expected impact
1. **Reorganize tools by function and provider**
   - **Rationale**: Current mixed organization hinders discoverability and understanding of tool relationships
   - **Action**: Create clear subfolders (core/, diagnostics/, providers/kimi/, providers/glm/, utilities/) with appropriate file moves
   - **Expected Impact**: Improved discoverability, clearer code organization, and easier maintenance

2. **Standardize tool registration process**
   - **Rationale**: Inconsistent registration creates confusion about which tools are exposed to clients
   - **Action**: Implement clear registration policy where exposed tools must be in TOOL_MAP, with separate category for internal-only utilities
   - **Expected Impact**: Eliminates ambiguity about tool availability, reduces accidental exposure, simplifies client integration

3. **Implement universal UI summary at server layer**
   - **Rationale**: Only some tools (like ThinkDeep) emit ui_summary, creating inconsistent user experiences
   - **Action**: Modify server.py to apply standardized UI summary to all ToolOutput objects, deprecating tool-specific implementations
   - **Expected Impact**: Consistent UI across all tools, reduced code duplication, easier maintenance

## Broken Mermaid flag
No broken Mermaid detected - the flowchart syntax appears correct and properly formatted.

## Verification checklist (5 items)
1. Verify all registered tools in TOOL_MAP have corresponding implementations in the tools directory
2. Confirm no sensitive internal utilities are accidentally exposed through the registry
3. Check provider-specific tools are properly grouped and documented
4. Validate fallback mechanism in server.py correctly handles missing registry scenarios
5. Ensure all diagnostic and maintenance tools are either properly registered or clearly marked as internal-only

```md
## Summary in 5 bullets
- Proposes reorganizing tools into logical domains (workflows, providers, diagnostics, orchestrators, streaming, capabilities) for improved clarity and discoverability
- Introduces a "manager-first" architecture where GLM-4.5-flash acts as the default manager that either answers simple prompts directly or delegates to a Planner tool
- Implements a universal UI summary at the server layer to provide consistent metadata across all tools including step information, model details, duration, and formatted summaries
- Outlines a non-destructive migration plan with phases: documentation, registry updates, batched file moves, verification, and cleanup
- Addresses several redundancies including duplicate streaming tools, similar diagnostics utilities, and separate file cleanup implementations for different providers

## Structural inconsistencies
1. **Inconsistent Mermaid syntax**: First diagram uses `flowchart LR` while second uses different node styling conventions (`T((Tool Instance))` vs `T{Tool function}`)
2. **Missing Mermaid closing tag**: First Mermaid diagram lacks closing ```` tag
3. **Inconsistent capitalization**: Section headers mix title case ("YES/NO Summary") with sentence case ("Design goals")
4. **Inconsistent mapping notation**: Uses both arrows (`->`) and hyphens (`-`) for file mappings
5. **Missing context for "recommend.py"**: Mentioned in mapping but purpose and destination not explained
6. **Ambiguous tool categorization**: `planner.py` appears under workflows/ but has special role in manager-first architecture

## 3 actionable fixes with rationale and expected impact
1. **Standardize Mermaid syntax and add proper closing tags**
   - **Rationale**: Inconsistent syntax could cause rendering issues and make diagrams harder to maintain
   - **Fix**: Use consistent node styling throughout and ensure all Mermaid blocks have proper opening and closing tags
   - **Expected Impact**: Improved readability and reliability of documentation diagrams

2. **Consolidate duplicate streaming and diagnostic tools**
   - **Rationale**: Overlapping tools (streaming_demo_tool.py vs stream_demo.py, streaming_smoke_tool.py vs ws_daemon_smoke.py) create confusion and maintenance overhead
   - **Fix**: Designate one canonical tool per function and create aliases or deprecation notices for others
   - **Expected Impact**: Reduced code duplication, clearer tool boundaries, and easier maintenance

3. **Implement a shared retention helper for file cleanup**
   - **Rationale**: GLM and Kimi have separate file cleanup implementations that likely share similar logic
   - **Fix**: Create a shared utility in shared/ with provider adapters for specific cleanup needs
   - **Expected Impact**: Reduced code duplication, consistent cleanup policies across providers, and easier extension to new providers

## Broken Mermaid flags
1. First Mermaid diagram missing closing ```` tag
2. Inconsistent node styling between diagrams (round nodes vs decision diamonds)
3. Second diagram uses `subgraph` syntax which may not render consistently across all Mermaid renderers

## Verification checklist (5 items)
1. Verify all tools in TOOL_MAP have corresponding entries in proposed folder structure
2. Test universal UI wrapper correctly captures metadata from all tool types without breaking existing functionality
3. Confirm manager-first routing logic correctly classifies prompts as "very simple" vs requiring delegation
4. Validate parallel execution of GLM browsing and Kimi file ingestion works without race conditions
5. Ensure migration plan maintains backward compatibility through import shims during transition period

# Universal UI Summary Architecture Analysis

## Summary (5 bullets)
- Designed a server-level UI wrapper that provides consistent UI blocks for all tool responses without modifying individual tools
- Uses GLM-4.5-flash as a manager for classification and simple answers with deterministic parameters (temperature: 0.2)
- Maintains raw outputs intact for logging and next-step chaining while adding a ui_summary for display
- Implements manager-first routing that directs simple answers directly and complex prompts through appropriate tools
- Maintains conversation continuity through conversation_id and stores compact summaries of past steps

## Structural Inconsistencies
1. The ui_summary schema lists optional fields but doesn't clearly distinguish between required and optional fields
2. The manager-first routing Mermaid diagram shows "ThinkDeep" as a standalone tool without showing its connection to "Orchestrate"
3. Inconsistent naming conventions (hyphens in "GLM-4.5-flash" vs underscores in "ui_summary")
4. Storage posture mentions not storing user files but doesn't clarify how this interacts with conversation_id persistence
5. Implementation notes mention back-filling missing fields but don't specify behavior for critical missing fields

## Actionable Fixes

1. **Clarify required vs optional fields in ui_summary schema**
   - Rationale: Current listing creates ambiguity during implementation
   - Expected Impact: Clearer implementation guidelines and consistent behavior across tool integrations

2. **Fix the "ThinkDeep" routing in the manager-first routing diagram**
   - Rationale: Current diagram is incomplete and may mislead implementation
   - Expected Impact: More accurate visual representation of the routing flow

3. **Define fallback behavior for missing critical fields**
   - Rationale: Implementation notes mention back-filling but don't specify edge case handling
   - Expected Impact: More robust implementation with defined behavior for missing metadata

## Broken Mermaid
No broken Mermaid diagrams detected. Both diagrams appear syntactically correct.

## Verification Checklist
1. Verify server-level UI wrapper preserves raw outputs while adding ui_summary
2. Verify GLM-4.5-flash manager parameters are correctly configured for deterministic behavior
3. Verify conversation_id is properly maintained across different tool interactions
4. Verify manager correctly routes simple answers vs complex tool selection
5. Verify ui_summary schema implementation matches the defined structure

# File Analysis: server_deep_dive_2025-09-20.md

## Summary (5 bullets)
- server.py is a large, cross-cutting module handling tool registry, request routing, prompts, error handling, and UI logic
- Proposed modularization would split server.py into focused modules: core, registry, handlers, routing, ui, and prompts
- Current pain points include multiple concerns in one file, difficulty in testing isolated areas, and entangled UI logic
- Universal UI wrapper is proposed as a non-invasive addition to response payloads with feature-flag gating
- Migration plan outlines 5 specific extraction steps to reduce coupling and enable independent evolution

## Structural Inconsistencies
- Mixed documentation formats (markdown with code structure proposals)
- Inconsistent indentation in "Universal UI wrapper" section
- Inconsistent numbering (migration uses numbered steps while others use bullets)
- Verification section is disproportionately brief compared to other sections
- Mermaid diagram uses outdated syntax

## Actionable Fixes
1. **Update Mermaid syntax**: Change `flowchart TD` to `graph TD`
   - Rationale: Ensures compatibility with current Mermaid standards
   - Expected impact: Architecture diagram renders correctly across documentation platforms

2. **Standardize formatting**: Apply consistent indentation and bullet point usage throughout
   - Rationale: Improves readability and makes migration plan easier to execute
   - Expected impact: Creates more professional, easier-to-follow documentation

3. **Expand verification section**: Add detailed validation steps beyond the current 3 items
   - Rationale: Complex refactoring requires comprehensive validation
   - Expected impact: Provides clearer checkpoints for validating modularization success

## Broken Mermaid
The Mermaid diagram uses outdated syntax `flowchart TD` instead of modern `graph TD`

## Verification Checklist
1. Verify all tool endpoints (list_tools, chat, analyze, thinkdeep) function correctly after modularization
2. Confirm suggested model error paths still return ToolOutput format on mismatch
3. Validate ui_summary presence in all tool responses when feature is enabled
4. Ensure no circular imports exist between new modules
5. Test registry loads correctly before handlers are registered

```md
## Summary in 5 bullets
- Current project structure mixes canonical modules in src/ with legacy folders at root level
- Key duplicates exist in providers (src/providers vs legacy providers/) and routing (src/router vs routing/)
- Tools/ directory reorganized with entry tools in subfolders and helper layers at root
- Legacy folders marked for removal after import confirmation
- Mermaid diagram shows top-level structure with tools/ broken into subdirectories

## Structural inconsistencies
1. **Mixed canonical vs legacy structure**: Some domains have canonical implementations in src/ while legacy versions remain at root
2. **Inconsistent tool organization**: Tools split between subfolders (canonical) and root helper layers
3. **Vestigial legacy folders**: providers/ and routing/ exist alongside their canonical src/ implementations
4. **Unclear canonical paths**: No explicit documentation of which paths are source of truth for each domain
5. **Missing folder documentation**: Several top-level folders lack detailed breakdown in the document

## 3 actionable fixes with rationale and expected impact
1. **Remove legacy providers/ and routing/ folders**
   - Rationale: Explicitly marked as legacy and replaced by canonical implementations in src/
   - Expected Impact: Cleaner structure, reduced confusion, elimination of duplicate maintenance burden

2. **Standardize tool organization under tools/ subdirectories**
   - Rationale: While helper layers remain at root, having all entry tools in subfolders creates consistency
   - Expected Impact: Improved discoverability, clearer separation of concerns, easier onboarding

3. **Create canonical path mapping document**
   - Rationale: Document doesn't explicitly state which paths should be used for development and imports
   - Expected Impact: Reduced confusion for new developers, consistent import patterns

## Broken Mermaid flags
No broken Mermaid elements detected - the diagram correctly represents the described structure.

## Verification checklist (5 items)
1. Confirm no imports exist from legacy providers/ and routing/ folders before removal
2. Verify all MCP tools are properly registered and accessible after reorganization
3. Check that all imports use canonical src/ paths for providers and router
4. Ensure documentation references are updated to reflect canonical structure
5. Run smoke tests to confirm all functionality works after structural changes

```md
## Summary in 5 bullets
- Proposes a coherent folder design with phased migration and validation plan for the EX-AI-MCP-Server project
- Establishes clear design principles including single source of truth and separation of MCP tools from helper layers
- Defines canonical locations for core logic (`src/`) and MCP tools (`tools/`) with specific subdirectory structures
- Outlines a manager-first routing architecture with provider parallelization for ThinkDeep orchestration
- Includes a phased migration plan with registry-first approach, smoke validations, and consolidation of duplicate domains

## Structural inconsistencies
1. **Inconsistent directory hierarchy**: Some directories are at root level (`streaming/`, `supabase/`) while others are nested under `tools/` or `src/`
2. **Overlapping responsibilities**: `tools/` directory contains both MCP tools and helper layers without clear separation
3. **Unclear consolidation strategy**: Mentions consolidating "orchestrators" and "streaming utilities" but lacks specific criteria
4. **Missing documentation**: No clear explanation of relationships between different directories
5. **Inconsistent naming patterns**: Mix of different naming conventions across directories (e.g., "daemon/" vs "providers/")

## 3 actionable fixes with rationale and expected impact
1. **Standardize directory naming and hierarchy**
   - **Fix**: Establish consistent naming patterns (e.g., all lowercase with hyphens) and logical grouping of related directories
   - **Rationale**: Inconsistent naming creates cognitive overhead and navigation difficulties
   - **Expected impact**: Improved code readability, easier onboarding, and reduced maintenance overhead

2. **Create clear separation of concerns**
   - **Fix**: Define explicit boundaries between MCP tools, helper layers, and core runtime components with documentation
   - **Rationale**: Overlapping responsibilities lead to confusion and potential conflicts
   - **Expected impact**: Better code organization, reduced duplication, and clearer ownership

3. **Implement concrete consolidation criteria**
   - **Fix**: Define specific metrics (e.g., dependency count, usage frequency, team feedback) for directory consolidation decisions
   - **Rationale**: Arbitrary consolidation increases risk of breaking changes
   - **Expected impact**: More systematic refactoring, better maintainability, and reduced technical debt

## Broken Mermaid flags
No broken Mermaid diagrams detected in the document.

## Verification checklist (5 items)
1. [ ] Confirm all proposed directories exist and follow consistent naming conventions
2. [ ] Validate that migration plan includes appropriate rollback mechanisms
3. [ ] Check that all tools are properly registered in TOOL_MAP
