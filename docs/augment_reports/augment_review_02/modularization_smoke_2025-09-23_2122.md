# P2 Modularization Smoke — 2025-09-23 21:22

- YES — Telemetry/RegistryBridge scaffolding present; dispatcher DRY‑RUN active; startup/WS handshake healthy.

## What was checked
- Startup logs show:
  - Telemetry touchpoint initialized (no‑op)
  - WS daemon listening on 127.0.0.1:8765
  - Lean tool registry active with expected tools
- handle_call_tool emits telemetry DRY‑RUN event without affecting flow.

## Notes
- Existing top‑level scripts already include back‑compat shim headers forwarding to canonical subfolders; no immediate content replacement required.
- Next batch will stage a small sample of thin shims only where missing.

## Next
1) Stage/verify thin shims where absent (if any)
2) Move a minimal safe batch (ws utilities) — then restart + smoke
3) Expand batch and repeat
