# Phase P2 — Completion & Validation — 2025-09-23 23:00

- YES — P2 fully completed with validations and documentation. No behavior changes introduced; all edits env‑gated or cosmetic.

## What was completed
- Server modularization (non‑breaking):
  - src/server: dispatcher.py (now logs DRY‑RUN route calls), telemetry.py, registry_bridge.py, circuit.py, fallback_orchestrator.py (earlier), dispatcher wiring in server.py with EX_USE_DISPATCHER env flag.
  - server.py: DRY‑RUN dispatcher call added (ignored result), telemetry touchpoint, registry bridge import.
- Scripts reorg & shims:
  - Confirmed canonical folders (ws, validation, diagnostics, kimi_analysis). Added/verified READMEs.
  - Added deprecation banners to top‑level shims; retained for back‑compat.
- Tool description/visibility cleanup:
  - tools/chat.py: user‑friendly, provider‑agnostic description.
  - tools/providers/kimi/kimi_tools_chat.py: clarified tool_choice/websearch wording & examples.

## Validations (EXAI‑WS MCP)
- Restarts: WS daemon listening on ws://127.0.0.1:8765; telemetry touchpoint initialized (no‑op); Lean tool registry active.
- Chat smokes (glm‑4.5‑flash):
  - Nonce returns: cobalt-falcon-2a7e, lilac-raven-4c0e
- Analyze smoke: analyze tool executed, 1/1 step complete, no schema errors.

- earlier P1/P2 smoke reports as referenced

## Notes
- EX_USE_DISPATCHER default is off; when enabled, dispatcher.route() logs a no‑op route attempt without changing behavior.
- Shims remain to avoid breaking external callers; next pass can slim to pure trampolines if desired.
