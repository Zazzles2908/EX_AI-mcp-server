# EXAI-WS Validation Run — 2025-09-23 20:19

- Provider/Model: GLM / glm-4.5-flash
- Tool: kimi_multi_file_chat (manager fallback orchestrator)
- Status: PASS — Functional summary produced with inline excerpt
- Fallback Path: KIMI upload → envelope (notfounderror) → inline excerpt injection → chat
- Unique phrase check: present (“amber-kite 911”)

## Prompt
Produce 4 bullets summarizing the file; include exactly one 3-5 line code excerpt; append the phrase 'amber-kite 911' verbatim at the end.

## Files
- c:\\Project\\EX-AI-MCP-Server\\README.md

## Observed Route (activity logs excerpts)
- [FALLBACK] received envelope: status=execution_error error_class=notfounderror
- [FALLBACK] invoking 'chat' fallback with local inline excerpts

## Model Output (excerpt)
> • EX MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects modern LLM providers (KIMI, GLM, OpenRouter) to MCP-compatible clients like Claude Desktop/CLI.
>
> • It provides a unified set of development tools including analyze, codereview, debug, refactor, tracer, testgen, precommit, and listmodels capabilities.
>
> • The server supports multiple deployment options including local development with virtualenv, Docker containers, and provides configuration examples for various client setups.
>
> • Advanced features include provider-native web browsing schemas, a hidden model router for auto model selection, and agentic audit capabilities with real models.

## Notes
- Kimi upload path still returns notfounderror in current environment; added path resolver in KimiUploadAndExtractTool and a conservative orchestrator fallback that injects local file excerpts when upload is unavailable.
- Next: unify tool envelopes/timeouts (P1), then stress validation.
