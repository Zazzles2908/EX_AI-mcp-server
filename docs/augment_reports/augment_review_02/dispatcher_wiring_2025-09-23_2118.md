# P2 – Dispatcher/Telemetry/RegistryBridge Wiring (DRY‑RUN) — 2025‑09‑23 21:18

- YES — Non‑behavioral scaffolding added and validated. Server restarted cleanly.

## What changed (no behavior change)
- server.py
  - Added Telemetry and RegistryBridge touchpoints (imports + init logs)
  - Added telemetry.record_event("tool_call_start", ...) inside handle_call_tool
  - Retained Dispatcher DRY‑RUN logging
- No routing or tool behavior altered; all changes are feature‑flag/diagnostic only.

## Evidence (EXAI‑WS MCP)
- Log excerpts:
  - 21:17:56 — server — INFO — Telemetry touchpoint initialized (no‑op)
  - 21:12:51/21:17:56 — ws_daemon — INFO — Starting WS daemon … server listening on 127.0.0.1:8765
- The RegistryBridge probe logs at DEBUG (suppressed under LOG_LEVEL=INFO), as intended.

## Quick sanity checks
- Kimi/GLM model routing still functions; no exceptions at startup.
- Prior P1 orchestrator/circuit behavior unaffected.

## Run summary (latest activity)
- Provider: EXAI‑WS MCP (local server)
- Model: glm‑4.5‑flash (manager path)
- Duration: 0.1–0.2s for activity; 3–15s for fallback chat operations (unchanged)
- Cost: n/a (provider API usage unchanged in this step)

## Next (P2 plan, same methodology as P1)
1) Scripts reorg scaffolding (create canonical subfolders + README markers; no file moves yet)
2) Add dispatcher/telemetry/reg‑bridge notes to docs and smoke‑validate
3) Prepare wrapper shim plan for legacy script paths

I will restart the server after each file addition/edit and capture MCP activity snippets in this folder.
