# P2 Batch 3 & 4 — Wrappers slimming + diagnostics/validation — 2025-09-23 21:31

- YES — Banners present; wrappers verified; no file moves required; WS daemon healthy; real model output captured.

## Scope
- Batch 3: Slim top‑level wrappers to pure trampolines (optional)
- Batch 4: Diagnostics/validation scripts — confirm canonical paths + shims; validate

## Findings
- Top‑level scripts already operate as back‑compat shims forwarding into canonical subfolders (ws, validation, diagnostics).
- To keep today’s run low‑risk and restart‑light, we retained existing trampolines and added deprecation banners (Batch 2). Further slimming (deleting legacy bodies) is optional and can be done in a later clean‑up pass.
- Canonical entries exist in scripts/ws, scripts/validation, scripts/diagnostics; no additional moves required in this pass.

## Validations (EXAI‑WS)
- Activity: WS listening on ws://127.0.0.1:8765; telemetry touchpoint initialized (no‑op)
- Chat smoke (glm‑4.5‑flash):
  - Nonce #1: marigold-wisp-7f2a → Output: marigold-wisp-7f2a
  - Nonce #2: tangerine-bolt-9d1c → Output: tangerine-bolt-9d1c

## Decision
- Batch 3 considered complete for this phase (deprecation banners + functional shims verified).
- Batch 4 complete (canonical structure confirmed; shims working; validations green).

## Next
1) P2 — Tool description/visibility cleanup (remove manager‑only vocab; ensure visibility tiers)
2) P2 — Validation from new paths (run ws/e2e wrappers; capture outputs)
3) P2 — Continue server modularization (thin server.py; surface dispatcher facade)
