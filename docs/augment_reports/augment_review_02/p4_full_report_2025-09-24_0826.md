# Phase 4 (P4) — Full Consolidated Report

- YES — P4 completed as planned with advisory-only AI Manager, tests, config simplification draft, tool/provider scaffolds, and end-to-end validations using real model outputs.

## Scope covered
1) Decision tree + advisory manager (already landed earlier in P4)
2) Markdown sanity + diagram fixes (landed)
3) Advisory plan logging (enabled via env)
4) Response pipeline tests + validations (unit + EXAI-WS) — completed
5) Config simplification (draft) — .env.simplified.example + scripts/migrate_config.py (dry-run)
6) Tool consolidation scaffold — tools/smart/smart_chat.py (advisory-only, not wired)
7) Native provider scaffolds — src/providers/{zhipu_native.py, moonshot_native.py} (not wired)

## What changed (files)
- .env.simplified.example (new): simplified target config
- scripts/migrate_config.py (new): generates .env.new from current .env (dry-run)
- tools/smart/smart_chat.py (new): advisory-only scaffold, not registered
- src/providers/zhipu_native.py (new): Zhipu provider stubs
- src/providers/moonshot_native.py (new): Moonshot provider stubs
- docs/augment_reports/augment_review_02/p4_batch5_tests_2025-09-24_0815.md (earlier)

## Unit tests (Batch 5)
- Ran: `python -m unittest -v tests.test_fallback_orchestrator`
- Result: 6 passed, 0 failed
- Coverage: error envelope detection across success/error/plain/empty cases

Example passing log
```
[FALLBACK] success status but empty content (not flagging as error)
Ran 6 tests in 0.001s
OK
```

## EXAI-WS validations (Batch 5 + final P4 run)
- Server restart: OK (daemon up on ws://127.0.0.1:8765)
- GLM chat → nonce: coral-lynx-0b3e (real output)
- Kimi multi-file chat → nonce: mint-otter-4c1a (real output)

Activity log excerpts
```
{'event': 'ai_manager_plan', 'tool': 'chat', ... 'suggested_provider': 'glm', 'suggested_model': 'glm-4.5-flash'}
RESPONSE_DEBUG: raw_previews: #0 {"status":"continuation_available","content":"coral-lynx-0b3e" ...}

{'event': 'ai_manager_plan', 'tool': 'kimi_multi_file_chat', ... 'suggested_provider': 'kimi', 'suggested_model': 'kimi-k2-0905-preview', 'has_files': True}
RESPONSE_DEBUG: raw_previews: #0 {"model":"kimi-k2-0905-preview","content":"mint-otter-4c1a","file_ids":[...]} 
```

## Config simplification (Batch 6)
- Template: .env.simplified.example (no secrets)
- Migrator (dry-run): scripts/migrate_config.py → writes .env.new with:
  - CORE PROVIDER KEYS, MODEL DEFAULTS, CORE FEATURES, TIMEOUTS, SERVER CONFIG, OPTIONAL PROVIDERS, ADVANCED
- Status: Draft only; no changes to existing .env. Safe to review and adopt.

## Tool consolidation (Batch 7)
- Added tools/smart/smart_chat.py (advisory scaffold)
- Not registered (no runtime behavior change). Will be gated in P5 when we wire it.

## Native providers (Batch 8)
- src/providers/zhipu_native.py and moonshot_native.py stubs added
- Not wired. Safe for future integration without impacting current runtime.

## Current runtime status
- AI Manager: advisory-only (no routing changes)
- Fallback orchestrator: active; error detection validated
- Tool registry: unchanged; lean tool set active
- Logs: RESPONSE_DEBUG and ai_manager_plan present

## Risks and mitigations
- Wiring smart_chat or native providers prematurely could destabilize: deferred to P5 under flags
- Config migration: keeps original .env intact; .env.new is reviewable/diffable

## Recommendation
- Accept P4 changes; proceed to P5 to operationalize manager-controlled routing behind env flags and complete the consolidation.

# Phase 5 (P5) — Proposed next steps

Goals
- Turn advisory AI Manager into operational routing (env-gated)
- Wire smart_chat and provider stubs behind flags
- Add E2E tests and performance/streaming checks

Plan
1) Manager routing (env-gated)
   - EX_AI_MANAGER_ROUTE=true enables manager-selected provider/model per tool
   - Implement minimal switch in server dispatcher (keep fallback intact)
   - Log pre/post route decisions + response latencies
2) smart_chat activation
   - ENABLE_SMART_CHAT=true registers tools/smart/smart_chat.py
   - For chat-only cases, route through consolidated path; preserve parity
3) Native provider wiring (minimal)
   - ENABLE_ZHIPU_NATIVE / ENABLE_MOONSHOT_NATIVE to surface stubs
   - Map minimal method(s) to safe ‘stub’ responses with clear provider labels
4) Test suite expansion
   - Add manager routing unit tests (decision application, gating)
   - Add E2E smoke: chat, multi-file chat, chat-with-tools
   - Latency + envelope validation assertions (RESPONSE_DEBUG)
5) Config adoption
   - Generate .env.new via migrate_config.py; assist review
   - Document cutover checklist; no secrets in example files
6) Docs
   - Update decision tree with routing branches (operational)
   - Add risk/rollback (toggle flags off returns to pre-P5 behavior)

Exit criteria
- With routing OFF → behavior identical to P4 (parity proven)
- With routing ON → routes as advised; logs show decisions; tests pass
- No crashes/regressions; fallbacks still functional
