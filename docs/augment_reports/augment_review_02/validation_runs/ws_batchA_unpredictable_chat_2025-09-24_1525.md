# WS Validation — Batch A unpredictable prompt

One-liner: YES — Live daemon responded; real output captured; activity log shows RESPONSE_DEBUG and TOOL_COMPLETED for chat.

## Prompt
Invent a brand-new sport in one sentence that plausibly merges chess openings with parkour course design; do not mention chess or parkour explicitly.

## Output (actual)
Strategic Flow Racing is a dynamic physical competition where athletes navigate through modular obstacle courses by selecting from predetermined movement sequences, with each choice creating new pathways and opportunities for competitors to outmaneuver opponents.
