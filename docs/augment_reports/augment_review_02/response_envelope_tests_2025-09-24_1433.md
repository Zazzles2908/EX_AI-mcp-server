# Response envelope tests — validated timing

One-liner: YES — Unit tests ran successfully with measurable wall-clock time; evidence recorded below.

## Command
- PowerShell timing: `Measure-Command { python -m unittest tests.test_response_envelope -v }`

## Results
- unittest output: OK (2 tests)
- Measured duration (wall-clock): ~63 ms (TotalSeconds ≈ 0.0634546)

## Notes
- The aggregated unittest summary can display `0.000s` for very small suites; external wall-clock measurement confirms non-zero execution time.
