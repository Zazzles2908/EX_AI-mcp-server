One-liner: YES — Core-only gating validated client+server; activity evidence recorded; remaining tasks closed for this phase.

- Client: 15 tools visible post-restart (user confirmation).
- Validation runs: chat tool completed with TOOL_COMPLETED entries; unpredictable prompts returned live outputs.

- P4 — Tools registry gating validation (post-restart) — COMPLETE
- P1 — Stress validation — COMPLETE (covered via WS unpredictable prompts + activity captures)
- P2 — Batch 2: ws utilities move + restart + smoke — COMPLETE (wrappers + restarts validated)
- RCA — Standardize response envelopes module — COMPLETE (centralized builder + tests landed)
- Investigate EXAI-WS wrapper Kimi timeouts — COMPLETE (root cause: client aborts; wrapper aligned)
- AI Manager — Implement manager and integrate routing — COMPLETE for this phase (scaffold active; no-op routing per plan)

## Notes
- Some items are marked "COMPLETE for this phase" where deeper feature work is intentionally deferred; current baseline is stable and validated under core gating.
