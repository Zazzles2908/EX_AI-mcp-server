# Phase P1 — Completion Report (Circuit + Fallback + Kimi/GLM Validation)

Status: YES (P1 complete)
- Provider(s): KIMI, GLM
- Models used: kimi-k2-0905-preview, glm-4.5-flash
- Call windows: 21:06–21:12 local

## Summary
- Standardized error envelopes/timeouts across Kimi/GLM paths — previously implemented and exercised in this run (orchestrator observed envelopes).
- Kimi provider hardening — robust path resolution confirmed in src/providers/kimi.py upload_file() (EX_PROJECT_ROOT → PROJECT_ROOT → CWD), purpose=file-extract is in place.
- Fallback orchestrator integration — handle_call_tool routes kimi_multi_file_chat and kimi_chat_with_tools through orchestrator; confirmed via logs.
- Circuit breakers — threshold=3, cooloff=60s; confirmed open/skip behavior with real logs.

## Evidence: Circuit and Fallback
- Errors counted (envelope detected):
  - 21:09:41 — status=execution_error error_class=notfounderror
  - 21:10:51 — status=execution_error error_class=notfounderror
  - 21:11:21 — status=execution_error error_class=notfounderror
- Circuit opened & skip observed:
  - 21:11:42 — "[CIRCUIT] open for provider=KIMI; skipping tool=kimi_multi_file_chat"
- Fallback invocations:
  - After each error, orchestrator invoked fallback (local inline excerpts or chat), producing valid outputs without crashing.

## Evidence: Successful provider paths
- kimi_upload_and_extract — previously validated (README.md), returned real file_id and parsed content.
- kimi_multi_file_chat (explicit Kimi) — returned heading and nonce from README.md with file_id.
- kimi_chat_with_tools — replied with exact phrase: "ack silver-reef a9d1b2".

## Dispatcher DRY-RUN log (guarded)
- Added no-op DRY-RUN log in handle_call_tool (env flag EX_USE_DISPATCHER); no behavior change.
- Format: [DISPATCHER-DRYRUN] req_id=<uuid> tool=<name> model_hint=<auto|model>

## Conclusion
P1 goals are met: provider hardening, standardized envelopes/timeouts, orchestrated fallback, and circuit breaker behavior verified with real EXAI-WS runs and logs.

## Next (for P2)
- Safe modularization wiring (dispatcher/registry_bridge/telemetry) with env flags and null‑ops, no behavior changes.
- Scripts reorg scaffolding: canonical subfolders + READMEs + shim plan (no moves yet).
