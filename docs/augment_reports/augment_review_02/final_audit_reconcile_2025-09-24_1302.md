# Final audit — Reconcile implemented work vs external review (first pass)

One‑liner: YES — Current implementation aligns with the cleanup/modernization goals; tracked deltas and any follow‑ups below.

## Source of truth
- docs/external_review/Current_review/immediate_fixes.md
- docs/external_review/Current_review/implementation_roadmap (1).md
- docs/external_review/Current_review/root_cause_analysis.md
- docs/external_review/Current_review/system_cleanup_plan.md

## Mapping highlights
- Immediate fixes
  - AI‑manager misrouting disabled by default (EX_AI_MANAGER_ROUTE=false) — DONE
  - Kimi MF early‑cancel classified as client_abort_suspected — DONE
  - Heartbeat interval reduced (EXAI_WS_PROGRESS_INTERVAL_SECS=2.0) — DONE
- Roadmap alignment
  - Batch modularization and wrappers completed; server helpers introduced — DONE
  - Tools consolidation plan + scaffolds (smart_chat, file_chat) — DONE (gated)
  - Provider scaffolds (GLM, Kimi) — DONE (not wired)
- RCA coverage
  - Standard response envelope helper in server path — DONE
  - Unit tests added for envelope formatting — DONE
  - WIP log evidence appended to kimi_timeouts_WIP.md — DONE
- System cleanup plan
  - Config simplification draft + migrator (dry‑run to .env.new) — DONE
  - .env.new added to .gitignore to prevent key leakage — DONE
  - Registry visibility unchanged; avoids surprise surface area — DONE

## Follow‑ups (tracked or proposed)
- AI‑manager operational routing proposal documented; keep OFF by default until canary validates stability
- Optional native provider adapters (zhipuai SDK) behind extras/flags — defer wiring
- Broader test sweep when provider credentials and environment are ready; keep current unit tests small and hermetic
