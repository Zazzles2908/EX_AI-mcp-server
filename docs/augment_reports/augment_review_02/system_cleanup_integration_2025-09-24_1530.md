# System Cleanup Integration — Batch A (import-safe)

One-liner: YES — response_handler, model_resolver, and mcp_protocol loaded import-safely; no behavior changes; daemon restarted cleanly.

## What was integrated
- server.py: added optional imports and singletons
  - ResponseHandler initialized (no-op usage for now)
  - ModelResolver initialized (no-op usage for now)
  - MCP protocol utils (ensure_messages) loaded
- All under try/except with logging; no runtime behavior change

## Restart
- Performed restart via scripts/ws_start.ps1 -Restart
- Activity shows server listening

## Validation
- Unpredictable chat prompt returned real output
- Activity log shows RESPONSE_DEBUG and TOOL_COMPLETED for chat

## Next
- Provider routing stability checks
- Prepare Batch B for registry gating (single Augment restart will be requested)
