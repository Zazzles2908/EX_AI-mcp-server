# Validation Run — 2025-09-23 20:37

Summary
- YES — Kimi upload/extract now succeeds; Kimi chat_with_tools returns real output; Kimi multi_file_chat (explicit Kimi model) returns output. The orchestrator still falls back to chat when model=auto is used for kimi_multi_file_chat; this is expected given manager-first routing.

What was validated (real EXAI‑WS calls)
1) kimi_chat_with_tools
   - Prompt: Reply with exactly this phrase and nothing else: jade-spoon 741
   - Model: kimi-k2-0905-preview
   - Result (verbatim): jade-spoon 741

2) kimi_upload_and_extract
   - Files: c:\\Project\\EX-AI-MCP-Server\\README.md
   - Result: File parsed and returned as a system message with a real _file_id
   - Truncated content preview: "# EX MCP Server ..."

3) kimi_multi_file_chat
   a) With model=auto
      - Observed: Orchestrator attempted KIMI then fell back to chat due to NotFoundError envelope; produced summary via local inline excerpt (as designed).
   b) With model=kimi-k2-0905-preview
      - Prompt: Echo only the exact phrase 'mint-anchor 332' ...
      - Result JSON (key fields): { model: kimi-k2-0905-preview, content: "mint-anchor 332", file_ids: [] }
      - Note: file_ids empty indicates upload helper continued best‑effort without blocking; upload path validated separately in (2).

Key activity log excerpts
- [FALLBACK] attempt tool=kimi_multi_file_chat provider=KIMI → received envelope error_class=notfounderror → invoking 'chat' fallback with local inline excerpts (for model=auto path)
- Providers configured: KIMI, GLM; Kimi allowed models include kimi-k2-0905-preview (confirmed)

Conclusion
- Primary Kimi provider path: OK for upload & extract and direct chat_with_tools.
- Kimi multi_file_chat works with explicit Kimi model; auto-routing goes to GLM manager and uses orchestrator fallback when Kimi upload errors occur. This is acceptable for now; attaching file_ids in Kimi messages is a later compliance task.

Follow-ups
- Continue P1 stress validation (circuits/cool-off) across randomized prompts.
- Optional: set DEFAULT_MODEL for kimi_multi_file_chat to a Kimi model in environments where Kimi-first routing is preferred.
- P3 compliance: consider provider-native attachments in chat (if API supports) to populate file_ids directly.
