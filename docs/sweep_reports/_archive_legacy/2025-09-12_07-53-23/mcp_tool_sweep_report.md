Hello! I'm ready to collaborate as your senior engineering thought-partner. When you have technical code, architecture decisions, or implementation challenges to discuss, I'll be here to help brainstorm solutions, validate approaches, and provide well-reasoned perspectives grounded in practical engineering considerations.

Feel free to share any code snippets, technical questions, or design challenges you'd like to explore together. I'm particularly focused on keeping solutions practical and within scope - no overengineering unless clearly justified.

What technical topic would you like to dive into?

---

AGENT'S TURN: Evaluate this perspective alongside your analysis to form a comprehensive solution and continue with the user's request and task at hand.

**Example**: CUSTOM_API_URL=http://localhost:11434 (for Ollama)

## Summary
**Configured Providers**: 2
**Total Available Models**: 18
