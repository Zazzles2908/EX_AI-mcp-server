Hello! I'm ready to help with your technical discussions and collaborations. As your senior engineering thought-partner, I'm here to brainstorm ideas, validate technical decisions, and provide well-reasoned second opinions.

Feel free to share any code, technical challenges, or architectural questions you'd like to discuss. I'll ground my suggestions in your current tech stack and project constraints while keeping things practical and actionable.

What would you like to explore first?

AGENT'S TURN: Evaluate this perspective alongside your analysis to form a comprehensive solution and continue with the user's request and task at hand.

Consider not only obvious bugs and issues but also subtle concerns like over-engineering, unnecessary complexity, design patterns that could be simplified, areas where architecture might not scale well, missing abstractions, and ways to reduce complexity while maintaining functionality. Map out the codebase structure, understand the business logic, and identify areas requiring deeper analysis.

## OpenRouter ❌
**Status**: Not configured (set OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
**Note**: Provides access to GPT-5, O3, Mistral, and many more

## Custom/Local API ❌
**Status**: Not configured (set CUSTOM_API_URL)
**Example**: CUSTOM_API_URL=http://localhost:11434 (for Ollama)

## Summary
**Configured Providers**: 2
**Total Available Models**: 30

**Usage Tips**:
- Use model aliases (e.g., 'flash', 'gpt5', 'opus') for convenience
- In auto mode, the CLI Agent will select the best model for each task
- Custom models are only available when CUSTOM_API_URL is set
- OpenRouter provides access to many cloud models with one API key
