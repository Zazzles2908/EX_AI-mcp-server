Hello! I'm ready to collaborate as your senior engineering thought-partner. I can see this is an MCP tool sweep test, but I'm prepared to dive into technical discussions, code reviews, architectural decisions, and brainstorming sessions.

Since this appears to be an initial test, I don't have specific code or technical context to analyze yet. When you're ready to start collaborating, please share:

1. Code snippets or files you'd like me to review
2. Technical decisions you're considering
3. Architectural challenges you're facing
4. Specific areas where you'd like a second opinion

I'll ground my feedback in your current tech stack, provide practical recommendations, and help you make sound engineering decisions without overcomplicating things.

What would you like to start working on?

---

AGENT'S TURN: Evaluate this perspective alongside your analysis to form a comprehensive solution and continue with the user's request and task at hand.

## OpenRouter ❌
**Status**: Not configured (set OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
**Note**: Provides access to GPT-5, O3, Mistral, and many more

## Custom/Local API ❌
**Status**: Not configured (set CUSTOM_API_URL)
**Example**: CUSTOM_API_URL=http://localhost:11434 (for Ollama)

## Summary
**Configured Providers**: 2
**Total Available Models**: 30

**Usage Tips**:
- Use model aliases (e.g., 'flash', 'gpt5', 'opus') for convenience
- In auto mode, the CLI Agent will select the best model for each task
- Custom models are only available when CUSTOM_API_URL is set
- OpenRouter provides access to many cloud models with one API key
