## Phase 4 — SDK consolidation + file upload flows (Kimi & GLM) — Completed

This phase was executed with EXAI as the partner tool and focuses on finishing the OpenAI-compatible base move, adding native file upload capability for GLM, and standardizing the tools to go through providers instead of raw HTTP.

### What changed (code)

1) OpenAI-compatible base migrated and completed
- src/providers/openai_compatible.py now contains the full implementation (migrated from providers/openai_compatible.py) including:
  - Robust generate_content with retry/backoff, streaming and non-streaming handling, usage extraction, image support, and o3-pro responses endpoint support
  - Token counting fallback, parameter validation, error retry classification, and image dataURL processing

2) GLM provider: first-class file uploads (SDK + HTTP fallback)
- src/providers/glm.py
  - Added upload_file(file_path: str, purpose: str = "agent") -> str
  - Uses zhipuai SDK when available; falls back to HTTP multipart via HttpClient
  - Normalizes id extraction across response shapes
  - Added small imports: pathlib.Path, mimetypes

3) Shared HTTP multipart helper
- utils/http_client.py
  - Added post_multipart(path, files, data, headers) to support multipart/form-data uploads cleanly

4) Tools refactor for GLM files
- tools/glm_files.py
  - Switched from direct requests.post to provider.upload_file
  - Standardized chat call to prov.generate_content(...) instead of direct prov.client usage
  - This avoids the previous bug where prov.client wasn’t defined when the native SDK path is used

5) Kimi flow context
- The earlier Kimi upload tool already uses provider.upload_file and retrieves parsed content via prov.client.files.content(...). Leaving intact as it aligns with Moonshot/Kimi Files API behavior (content extraction available), unlike GLM.

### Why these changes matter
- Single canonical OpenAI-compatible base under src/: fixes split-brain and keeps provider behavior consistent
- GLM upload via provider: eliminates raw HTTP handling in tool layer; enables SDK acceleration when present
- Multipart helper: reusable, safer uploads without manually setting Content-Type headers
- Tool normalization: reduces direct client coupling and improves portability of execution paths

### Validation summary (safe, non-network checks)
- Syntax and structure validated after edits; no static import errors observed in the edited modules
- Provider methods now present and consistent with tool usage:
  - OpenAICompatibleProvider.generate_content exists and is complete
  - GLMModelProvider.upload_file exists and tools/glm_files.py references it
  - HttpClient.post_multipart present and used by GLM HTTP fallback

Network execution (Kimi/GLM APIs) was not run here to avoid external calls without explicit keys/permission. You can validate live via EXAI tools:
- Kimi: tools.kimi_upload_and_extract with a small text file; confirm returned system messages with _file_id
- GLM: tools.glm_upload_file with purpose=agent; confirm { file_id, filename } result (no content extract available)
- Chat: tools.glm_multi_file_chat and tools.kimi_multi_file_chat with 1–2 small files and a prompt

### Notes on endpoints and env vars
- Kimi default base URL remains configurable via KIMI_API_URL (default .ai). File extraction available via client.files.content(file_id)
- GLM default base URL uses open.bigmodel.cn (DEFAULT_BASE_URL). The tool now relies on provider implementation rather than its own GLM_API_URL wiring
- Ensure GLM_API_KEY and KIMI_API_KEY are set in the MCP server environment

### Follow-ups (optional next phase)
- Sweep codebase for any remaining imports of providers/openai_compatible.py and point them to src/providers/openai_compatible.py (most high-signal paths already done)
- Add provider wrappers for any remaining file APIs used directly in tools (e.g., content retrieval for Kimi already present; GLM currently upload-only)
- Small ergonomics: expose provider.get_client() if we need direct passthrough in rare cases while keeping primary flow through provider methods
- End-to-end EXAI sweep with live calls (with your keys) to produce a pass/fail matrix and usage/latency table

### Changed files
- src/providers/openai_compatible.py (completed implementation)
- src/providers/glm.py (added upload_file; minor imports)
- utils/http_client.py (added post_multipart)
- tools/glm_files.py (refactored to provider-based upload and chat)

If you want, I can now run an EXAI live validation sweep with your configured keys and append a results table to this report as v5.
