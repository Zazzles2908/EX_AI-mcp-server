# Phase 1 – EXAI Review (rev02)

This revision records the follow-up EXAI codereview findings after production .env pruning and documentation neutrality updates.

## Validation Focus
- Check for any remaining client-specific phrasing
- Verify schemas still present canonical models after .env changes
- Confirm server gating remains client-agnostic
- Assess sweep report metadata and error clarity

## Key Findings
- Docs (analyze/debug/refactor/secaudit): client-neutral phrasing intact; guidance consistent with code (use_assistant_model, use_websearch).
- server.py: CLIENT_* with CLAUDE_* fallback verified; no branching on specific client names for allow/deny or defaults.
- config.py: transport and auto-mode comments neutral; no Claude-specific language.
- .env: allowed models now canonical; no snapshot/alias/provider ids.
- Sweep report: includes provider/model metadata and durations; workflow tools at step 1 succeed.

## Residual Items (non-blocking)
- CLAUDE.md, README-ORIGINAL.md, run-server.* still mention Claude in text; to be reorganized in Phase 2 as client guides or neutral messaging.
- Optional improvement: add a short “Canonical models” explainer in listmodels docs to explain absence of aliases in enums.

## Verdict
- Phase 1 complete and validated with EXAI codereview. Ready to proceed to Phase 2 planning.
