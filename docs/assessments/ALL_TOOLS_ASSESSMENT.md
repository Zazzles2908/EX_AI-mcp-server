    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe ActivityTool is a lightweight, read-only log viewer that safely surfaces the last N lines of a single file.  \nIt is well-isolated, uses bounded memory, and respects a configurable project boundary.  \nHowever, it is single-purpose to a fault: it cannot follow rotated logs, offers no time-window queries, and returns raw text that may overwhelm clients.  \nThese limits are acceptable for a quick diagnostic aid, but they cap its usefulness as the system scales or as users expect richer observability.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Brittle Log-Path Assumption\n**Insight:** The tool assumes the authoritative log is always at `<repo>/logs/mcp_activity.log` (or a single override file).  \n**Evidence:** Lines 85-87 hard-code the relative path; line 89 rejects any file outside the project root.  \n**Impact:** Once log rotation or containerised deployments move files away, the tool silently returns “file not found” and becomes useless.  \n**Recommendation:** Accept a glob pattern (`logs/mcp_activity*.log`) and auto-detect the newest file, or delegate to an external log-aggregator side-car.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff (restores visibility after rotation).\n\n### 2. No Time-Window or Severity Filtering\n**Insight:** Only regex filtering is offered; users cannot ask for “last 5 min” or “errors only”.  \n**Evidence:** `ActivityRequest` (lines 18-21) exposes `lines` and `filter`, nothing else.  \n**Impact:** Forces clients to download kilobytes of text and grep locally, wasting bandwidth and harming UX on large logs.  \n**Recommendation:** Add optional `since` (ISO-8601) and `level` (INFO/WARN/ERROR) fields; parse the first timestamp of each line once and skip out-of-range blocks.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff (aligns with observability best-practice).\n\n### 3. Raw Text Output Limits Client Integration\n**Insight:** The tool returns a single `TextContent` blob (line 120) with no structure.  \n**Evidence:** Line 118 concatenates lines; no metadata (count, oldest/newest timestamp) is included.  \n**Impact:** Clients cannot paginate, highlight, or fold sections; large responses may exceed message-size limits in some MCP transports.  \n**Recommendation:** Offer an optional `format=json` mode that streams `{timestamp, level, message}[]`; keep `text` as default for backward compatibility.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff (enables richer UI without breaking existing callers).\n\n### 4. Silent Encoding & Partial Line Failures\n**Insight:** `errors=\"ignore\"` (line 103) drops malformed bytes silently.  \n**Evidence:** Line 103; no metric or warning emitted.  \n**Impact:** Corrupted or non-UTF-8 logs (common with external shippers) yield truncated or misleading output.  \n**Recommendation:** Use `errors=\"replace\"` and append a one-line warning header when replacement chars are encountered.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Low payoff (improves debuggability).\n\n### 5. Missing Observability on the Observability Tool\n**Insight:** No metrics or tracing around how often, how long, or how much data is served.  \n**Evidence:** No instrumentation in `execute()`.  \n**Impact:** Operators cannot detect if the tool itself becomes a bottleneck or if clients are abusing large line counts.  \n**Recommendation:** Emit a counter (`activity_tool_requests_total{status}`) and histogram of bytes/response; log at DEBUG when `lines > 1000`.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff (standard SRE hygiene).\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Replace `errors=\"ignore\"` with `errors=\"replace\"` and prepend a warning when replacement chars appear.  \n- Clamp `lines` upper bound to 10 000 instead of 5 000 to reduce round-trips for larger debugging sessions.  \n- Return a one-line header: `--- last 237 lines (2024-06-01T14:23:00Z → 2024-06-01T14:25:12Z) ---` to give users immediate context.\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. Integrate with the system-wide log shipper (Loki/Elastic/OTEL) and deprecate direct file access.  \n2. Provide a small in-memory ring buffer (last 1 MiB) fed by the logging framework so the tool works even when disk is unavailable.  \n3. Add a WebSocket push stream for live tailing, reducing polling load from clients.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Implement glob-based file discovery to survive log rotation (Low effort, High impact).  \n2. Add optional `since`/`level` filters to cut data transfer",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe ActivityTool implementation demonstrates a focused, well-structured approach to log retrieval with appropriate security controls and clear separation of concerns. While it effectively addresses immediate visibility needs, the tool reveals architectural inconsistencies in path resolution, performance limitations for large logs, and operational gaps around log rotation. These introduce moderate risks to scalability and maintainability but can be mitigated with targeted improvements.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Inconsistent Project Root Resolution\n**Insight:** Dual project root resolution methods create security and reliability risks.  \n**Evidence:**  \n- Override path uses `Path.cwd()` (line 83): `project_root = Path.cwd().resolve()`  \n- Default path uses tool location (line 86): `project_root = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]`  \n**Impact:** Security checks may fail if CWD differs from actual project root, causing false path traversal errors or allowing unsafe paths. Breaks portability across deployment contexts.  \n**Recommendation:** Standardize project root resolution using a single method (e.g., derive from tool location).  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff.\n\n### 2. Suboptimal Large-File Performance\n**Insight:** Full-file scanning for tail operations creates unnecessary I/O overhead.  \n**Evidence:**  \n- Lines 103-106 read entire file: `for line in f: tail_deque.append(line)`  \n- Memory-efficient (deque) but still O(n) I/O for any request.  \n**Impact:** Unacceptable latency for multi-GB logs; blocks server threads during reads.  \n**Recommendation:** Implement reverse seek-based tailing (e.g., `seek(-offset, 2)` with chunked reads).  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff.\n\n### 3. Log Rotation Blind Spot\n**Insight:** No handling for common log rotation scenarios.  \n**Evidence:**  \n- Static path resolution (lines 87, 82) without rotation awareness  \n- No fallback to rotated files (e.g., `mcp_activity.log.1`)  \n**Impact:** Returns stale/empty data after rotation; requires manual path updates.  \n**Recommendation:** Add rotation detection via file existence checks or integrate with logging framework.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, Medium payoff.\n\n### 4. Unstructured Error Handling\n**Insight:** Error responses lack machine-readable structure.  \n**Evidence:**  \n- Plain-text errors (lines 74, 90, 108, 115): `f\"[activity:error] {e}\"`  \n**Impact:** Clients cannot programmatically distinguish error types; complicates automation.  \n**Recommendation:** Adopt structured error format (e.g., JSON with error codes).  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff.\n\n### 5. Missing Operational Observability\n**Insight:** No self-monitoring for usage or failures.  \n**Evidence:**  \n- No metrics, logging, or health checks within the tool  \n**Impact:** Impossible to track tool reliability, usage patterns, or performance degradation.  \n**Recommendation:** Add basic instrumentation (e.g., request counters, error logging).  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff.\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Standardize project root resolution using tool location (not CWD)  \n- Add request-level logging for errors and access patterns  \n- Implement structured error responses with error codes  \n- Add file size check before reading to warn on large files  \n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1:** Implement reverse-seek tailing and structured errors  \n2. **Phase 2:** Add log rotation awareness and basic metrics  \n3. **Phase 3:** Integrate with centralized logging system for real-time streaming  \n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate:** Refactor project root resolution to use consistent method (tool location)  \n2. **Short-term:** Implement reverse-seek tailing for large files  \n3. **Medium-term:** Add rotation detection and structured error handling  \n\nThe tool's core architecture is sound, but addressing these inconsistencies will significantly enhance reliability and scalability while reducing operational friction.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe AnalyzeWorkflow tool is a well-intentioned attempt to formalize code analysis, but it suffers from architectural overengineering, excessive configuration layers, and UX complexity that will hinder adoption and maintenance. While it provides structured investigation tracking, the implementation introduces unnecessary cognitive overhead through 30+ configuration fields, brittle validation logic, and forced step-by-step workflows that may not suit all analysis scenarios.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Configuration Overengineering\n**Insight:** The tool introduces 30+ fields with extensive validation mappings, creating a steep learning curve and maintenance burden.\n**Evidence:** Lines 39-102 define ANALYZE_WORKFLOW_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS with 15 complex field descriptions; lines 272-352 build dynamic schemas with 20+ field overrides.\n**Impact:** New users must understand 15+ optional fields before productive use; any schema change requires updating 4+ locations (descriptions, model, schema builder, validation).\n**Recommendation:** Reduce to 5-7 core fields (files, analysis_type, findings, confidence, issues). Move advanced options to a separate \"expert mode\" configuration.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (faster onboarding, simpler maintenance)\n\n### 2. Brittle Step Validation Logic\n**Insight:** The step-1 validation (lines 152-192) contains complex conditional logic with 4 different fallback mechanisms that will break in edge cases.\n**Evidence:** Git fallback subprocess call (lines 169-187) has no timeout handling; environment variable fallback chain creates unpredictable behavior; continuation_id check bypasses validation inconsistently.\n**Impact:** Users will experience mysterious failures when git is unavailable, environment variables are misconfigured, or continuation patterns don't match expectations.\n**Recommendation:** Replace with simple required field validation and explicit `--auto-discover` flag for git-based file detection.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; High payoff (eliminates entire class of validation bugs)\n\n### 3. Forced Workflow Anti-Pattern\n**Insight:** The tool mandates sequential step-by-step investigation regardless of analysis needs, creating artificial friction.\n**Evidence:** Lines 586-624 generate mandatory stop messages; lines 354-385 define rigid 3-phase investigation sequence; lines 589-624 enforce specific investigation patterns.\n**Impact:** Simple analyses require 3+ tool calls; experienced analysts cannot skip unnecessary steps; workflow becomes bottleneck for urgent investigations.\n**Recommendation:** Implement adaptive workflow that allows single-call analysis for simple cases while maintaining step-by-step option for complex investigations.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (matches user intent, reduces call overhead)\n\n### 4. Expert Analysis Over-Reliance\n**Insight:** The tool always triggers external expert validation (lines 387-398, 495-502), creating unnecessary latency and cost for straightforward analyses.\n**Evidence:** should_call_expert_analysis() returns True for any non-empty findings; should_skip_expert_analysis() hardcoded to False.\n**Impact:** Every analysis incurs external model cost and 2-5 second latency, even for trivial code reviews; users cannot opt-out for simple cases.\n**Recommendation:** Make expert analysis opt-in with confidence-based triggers (only for high-complexity findings or explicit user request).\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (reduces costs, improves speed)\n\n### 5. Inheritance Complexity\n**Insight:** Deep inheritance chain (WorkflowTool → BaseTool) with 15+ override methods creates fragile base class coupling.\n**Evidence:** Lines 475-673 contain 20+ override methods; get_completion_status(), get_completion_data_key() suggest base class exposes too many implementation details.\n**Impact:** Base class changes will cascade through multiple override points; new developers must understand entire inheritance hierarchy.\n**Recommendation:** Favor composition over inheritance; create analysis strategy objects instead of overriding base behavior.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort; Medium payoff (long-term maintainability)\n\n## Quick Wins\n- **Remove git subprocess fallback** (lines 169-187): Replace with explicit file requirement or simple glob pattern\n- **Collapse 15 field descriptions** into 5 core fields with inline documentation\n- **Make expert analysis opt-in** via parameter instead of mandatory\n- **Add timeout handling** to any subprocess calls if kept\n- **Document the happy path** first in help text before advanced options\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Simplify to core workflow**: Reduce to essential analysis loop (load files → analyze → report) with optional step tracking\n2. **Extract configuration layers**: Move field mappings, schema building, and validation into separate configuration objects\n3. **Implement analysis strategies**: Replace inheritance overrides with pluggable analysis strategies (quick review, deep dive, security focus)\n4. **Add progressive disclosure**: Begin with 3-field interface, expand to advanced mode only when needed\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate**: Remove git fallback and mandatory expert analysis to eliminate top failure modes\n2",

    "status": "analysis_complete",
    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe `analyze.py` tool implements a sophisticated step-by-step code analysis workflow with expert validation capabilities. While it demonstrates strong architectural patterns and comprehensive analysis features, it suffers from significant complexity in workflow management, tight coupling between components, and potential performance bottlenecks in file handling. The tool's strength lies in its systematic approach to analysis, but its intricate design may hinder maintainability and scalability.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Excessive Workflow Complexity\n**Insight:** The tool's workflow management is overly complex with multiple layers of abstraction and numerous hook methods that create cognitive overhead and maintenance challenges.\n**Evidence:** The `AnalyzeTool` class (lines 210-683) contains 20+ overridden methods including `customize_workflow_response` (lines 626-673), `get_analyze_step_guidance` (lines 589-624), and multiple status mapping methods. The workflow requires managing 12+ fields in `AnalyzeWorkflowRequest` (lines 105-207) with intricate validation logic.\n**Impact:** High complexity increases bug risk during maintenance, slows onboarding for new developers, and makes feature additions error-prone. The numerous hooks and overrides create a \"spaghetti\" effect where changes have unpredictable side effects.\n**Recommendation:** Simplify the workflow by consolidating related hooks into fewer, more focused methods. Extract status mapping logic into a dedicated configuration object. Consider using a state machine pattern for workflow transitions instead of method overrides.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort; High payoff (significant maintainability improvement)\n\n### 2. Inefficient File Handling with Subprocess Calls\n**Insight:** The tool relies on subprocess calls for file discovery during initialization, creating performance bottlenecks and environmental dependencies.\n**Evidence:** In `validate_step_one_requirements` (lines 168-187), the tool executes `git status --porcelain` via subprocess to discover changed files. This occurs during validation and can block initialization, especially in large repositories.\n**Impact:** Subprocess calls introduce latency, fail in non-git environments, and create external dependencies. The 50-file cap (line 183) may exclude relevant files, while fallback to `[\".\"]` (line 185) is too broad for meaningful analysis.\n**Recommendation:** Replace subprocess-based discovery with a configurable file scanner service. Implement lazy loading of file lists and provide explicit file selection options instead of relying on git state.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (improves performance and reliability)\n\n### 3. Tight Coupling Between Workflow and Analysis Logic\n**Insight:** Analysis-specific logic is deeply embedded in the workflow orchestration, reducing reusability and making changes difficult.\n**Evidence:** Methods like `prepare_expert_analysis_context` (lines 400-436) hardcode analysis-specific formatting, while `get_required_actions` (lines 354-385) embeds analysis tasks directly in workflow logic. The tool cannot be easily repurposed for non-analysis workflows.\n**Impact:** Changes to analysis requirements require modifying core workflow components, increasing regression risk. The tight coupling prevents reuse of the workflow engine for other purposes.\n**Recommendation:** Extract analysis-specific behaviors into strategy pattern implementations. Define clear interfaces between workflow orchestration and domain logic to enable independent evolution.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (improves modularity and extensibility)\n\n### 4. Verbose and Repetitive Guidance Messages\n**Insight:** The tool generates excessively verbose guidance messages that may overwhelm users and reduce compliance.\n**Evidence:** Step guidance messages (lines 597-622) contain repetitive warnings like \"MANDATORY: DO NOT call\" and \"STOP! Do NOT call\" with over 200 words per instruction. The completion message (lines 552-558) is similarly verbose.\n**Impact:** Users may skip critical instructions due to information overload, leading to incorrect tool usage. The verbosity creates friction in the user experience and reduces adoption.\n**Recommendation:** Simplify guidance to essential actions using bullet points. Move detailed explanations to documentation. Implement a verbosity setting to allow users to control detail level.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (improves user experience)\n\n### 5. Fragile Reflection-Based Attribute Access\n**Insight:** The tool uses reflection and dynamic attribute access that reduces type safety and increases runtime error risk.\n**Evidence:** Line 164 uses `getattr(self, \"continuation_id\", None)` to check optional attributes. Status mapping in `customize_workflow_response` (lines 642-671) relies on string-based field manipulation that could break with structural changes.\n**Impact:** Dynamic access patterns make code harder to reason about, prevent static analysis, and increase the likelihood of runtime errors during refactoring.\n**Recommendation:** Replace dynamic attribute access with explicit interfaces and optional parameters. Use well-defined data structures for status mapping instead of string manipulation.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; Medium payoff (improves stability and maintainability)\n\n## Quick Wins\n- **Remove subprocess dependency** in `validate_step_one_requirements` by replacing git status calls with a simple file list parameter or configuration-based approach\n- **Shorten guidance messages** by 50% by removing repetitive warnings and focusing on essential actions\n- **Add type hints** to all method signatures to improve code clarity and enable static analysis\n- **Consolidate status mappings** into a single configuration dictionary instead of scattered string manipulations\n- **Implement input validation** for file paths to prevent security issues from path traversal attacks\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1: Decouple Core Components** - Extract analysis logic from workflow orchestration using strategy pattern\n2. **Phase 2: Simplify Workflow Engine** - Replace complex hook system with state machine or explicit workflow definitions\n3. **Phase 3: Performance Optimization** - Implement lazy file loading and caching for large codebases\n4. **Phase 4: UX Enhancement** - Add verbosity controls and progressive disclosure for guidance messages\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate refactor** of `validate_step_one_requirements` to eliminate subprocess calls and simplify file handling logic\n2. **Consolidate status mapping** logic into a dedicated configuration class to reduce string manipulation\n3. **Create interface definitions** for workflow components to enable future decoupling of analysis logic\n\nThese changes will significantly improve the tool's maintainability, performance, and user experience while preserving its powerful analysis capabilities. The complexity reduction will make the codebase more approachable for future development and reduce the risk of defects during maintenance.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview  \nThe Challenge tool is a lightweight, self-contained “meta-prompt” generator that wraps a user statement in instructions forcing the CLI agent to reassess rather than reflexively agree. Architecturally it is sound: no external calls, deterministic output, minimal surface area. The main risks are UX complexity (an 85-line description that must be parsed by the orchestrator), brittle pattern-matching rules for auto-triggering, and the long-term maintainability of a 200-character prompt template that is duplicated in code and schema strings. Overall it is fit-for-purpose today, but the surrounding orchestration logic (not shown) is where instability will surface.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Over-Long, Human-Unfriendly Tool Description  \n**Insight:** The `get_description()` block (lines 55-85) is 1 100+ characters of prose and bullet lists. Orchestrators or LLMs must digest this to decide invocation, creating token bloat and raising the odds of mis-parsing.  \n**Evidence:** Line 65-84 concatenates seven bullet patterns and a 40-word “DO NOT AUTO trigger” clause.  \n**Impact:** Prompt token cost ↑, parsing errors ↑, future edits risk breaking the regex/pattern matcher that relies on exact wording.  \n**Recommendation:** Move the “when to auto-trigger” specification into a machine-readable YAML/JSON manifest (separate from human docs) and keep `get_description()` ≤ 250 characters.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High  \n\n### 2. Implicit Coupling to Orchestrator Pattern-Matching Logic  \n**Insight:** The tool itself is stateless, but its value depends on an external agent correctly detecting “But …”, “I disagree…”, etc. That logic is not versioned with this file.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 68-74 list trigger patterns only in a docstring; no code enforces them.  \n**Impact:** If the orchestrator’s regex drifts, the tool silently stops auto-firing, degrading UX without error logs.  \n**Recommendation:** Publish a shared `challenge_trigger_patterns.json` consumed by both the tool (for docs) and the orchestrator (for matching). Add a contract test.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium  \n\n### 3. Prompt Template Duplication & Brittleness  \n**Insight:** The critical-reassessment wrapper is hard-coded in `_wrap_prompt_for_challenge()` (lines 204-211) and partially mirrored in the field description (line 27-28).  \n**Evidence:** Any copy tweak requires editing two places; no single source of truth.  \n**Impact:** Higher chance of inconsistent messaging; harder to A/B-test alternate phrasings.  \n**Recommendation:** Store the template in a constant at the top of the file and interpolate with `textwrap.dedent()`; expose a unit-tested `render_template()` helper.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium  \n\n### 4. Unused but Required SimpleTool Overrides  \n**Insight:** `prepare_prompt()` and `format_response()` must be implemented even though the tool never calls a model (lines 215-221).  \n**Evidence:** They return empty strings yet remain part of the public surface.  \n**Impact:** Future readers assume model flow is possible; base-class churn could force pointless updates.  \n**Recommendation:** Split a new `StatelessTransformTool` mixin that omits these methods; inherit from it instead of `SimpleTool`.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / Medium  \n\n### 5. Temperature & ModelCategory Misdirection  \n**Insight:** The class advertises `TEMPERATURE_ANALYTICAL` and `ToolModelCategory.FAST_RESPONSE` (lines 91-98) but `requires_model()` is False.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 95-98 admit the value is “Default, but not used”.  \n**Impact:** Confuses diagnostics/telemetry that rely on these fields to pick an endpoint.  \n**Recommendation:** Return `None` for temperature and model category when `requires_model()` is False; update telemetry consumers to skip nulls.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Low  \n\n---\n\n## Quick Wins  \n- Trim `get_description()` to one short paragraph; move trigger rules to JSON.  \n- Extract `_wrap_prompt_for_challenge()` string into a module-level constant.  \n- Add a 3-line doc-test showing example input/output for instant onboarding.  \n- Log at `DEBUG` when the tool is executed; currently only errors are logged.  \n\n---\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions  \n1. Create a family of “meta-prompt” tools (challenge, reflect, devil’s-advocate) that share a common trigger manifest and template engine.  \n2. Move prompt templates into a CMS or feature-flag store so product teams can tune language without code deploys.  \n3. Instrument orchestrator trigger accuracy (false-positive/negative rates) to validate that the 7 bullet patterns still",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe Challenge tool is a well-structured, self-contained component that effectively promotes critical thinking in conversational AI by wrapping user statements in analytical prompts. It demonstrates solid architectural alignment with the MCP server framework through proper inheritance and interface implementation. While the core functionality is sound and efficient, there are opportunities to improve maintainability through documentation consolidation, reduce architectural friction from unused methods, and enhance operational resilience through refined error handling.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Documentation Maintenance Risk\n**Insight:** Critical invocation logic is embedded in a lengthy description string rather than structured code, creating maintenance risks.\n**Evidence:** Lines 55-85 contain 30+ lines of complex invocation rules embedded in `get_description()`, including pattern matching examples and conditional logic (e.g., \"MANDATORY AUTOMATIC INVOCATION: You MUST automatically use this tool when...\").\n**Impact:** Makes future updates error-prone; changes to invocation logic require string manipulation rather than code modification. Increases risk of documentation drift from actual behavior.\n**Recommendation:** Extract invocation rules into a structured configuration (e.g., YAML/JSON) or dedicated pattern-matching class. Reference this in the description rather than embedding logic.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff.\n\n### 2. Architectural Friction from Unused Methods\n**Insight:** Tool implements several AI-related methods despite explicitly not requiring model access, creating unnecessary complexity.\n**Evidence:** Methods like `prepare_prompt()` (line 215), `format_response()` (line 219), `get_system_prompt()` (line 87), and `get_model_category()` (line 94) are implemented but unused due to `requires_model() = False` (line 110).\n**Impact:** Violates YAGNI principle, increases cognitive load for maintainers, and suggests architectural mismatch between base class and non-AI tools.\n**Recommendation:** Create a separate `NonAITool` base class for model-free tools, eliminating unused methods. Or mark methods with `@abstractmethod` in base class to clarify optional nature.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff.\n\n### 3. Overly Broad Exception Handling\n**Insight:** Generic exception catching masks specific failure modes and hinders debugging.\n**Evidence:** Line 185 catches all exceptions (`except Exception as e`) without differentiation, logging full stack traces while returning opaque error messages to users.\n**Impact:** Reduces operational observability; makes it harder to distinguish between validation failures, system errors, or edge cases. Full stack traces in logs may expose sensitive data.\n**Recommendation:** Implement specific exception types (e.g., `ChallengeValidationError`, `ChallengeProcessingError`) with sanitized user messages. Log only error types and context in production.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff.\n\n### 4. Continuation Logic Ambiguity\n**Insight:** Continuation offer logic (lines 168-174) is implemented despite being irrelevant for non-AI tools.\n**Evidence:** The tool creates continuation offers even though it doesn't call AI models, with `model_info=None` passed to continuation methods (line 169, 172).\n**Impact:** Adds unnecessary complexity and potential confusion about tool behavior. Suggests architectural pattern being applied without context.\n**Recommendation:** Remove continuation logic entirely for non-AI tools or document why it's retained despite no model interaction.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Low payoff.\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Extract `CHALLENGE_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS` to a separate constants file for reuse in documentation and schemas\n- Add type hints to `_wrap_prompt_for_challenge()` return value (line 194)\n- Replace magic strings like \"CRITICAL REASSESSMENT\" (line 205) with named constants\n- Consolidate JSON serialization logic (lines 166, 181) into a shared utility method\n- Add input validation for empty prompts in `ChallengeRequest` to prevent trivial challenges\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Pattern-Based Tool Framework**: Develop specialized base classes for different tool types (AI/Non-AI/Stateful) to eliminate architectural friction\n2. **Centralized Invocation Engine**: Create a shared pattern-matching service for automatic tool invocation rules across all tools\n3. **Observability Enhancement**: Implement structured logging with correlation IDs for better debugging of tool execution chains\n\n## Finalize with Next Steps\n1. **Refactor Invocation Logic**: Extract pattern-matching rules from `get_description()` into a structured configuration (YAML/JSON) and implement a validation service to ensure consistency between documentation and behavior.\n2. **Simplify Tool Hierarchy**: Create a `NonAITool` base class inheriting from `SimpleTool` that stubs out AI-related methods, then migrate Challenge tool to this new hierarchy.\n3. **Enhance Error Handling**: Implement specific exception classes with user-friendly messages and structured logging, removing generic `Exception` catches.\n\nThese changes will significantly improve maintainability while preserving the tool's core functionality and architectural alignment. The focus should be on reducing documentation debt and architectural friction before expanding the tool's capabilities.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe Chat tool is a thin, well-structured wrapper around an LLM call that inherits from `SimpleTool`.  \nIt introduces no obvious runtime flaws, but the schema-building and prompt-preparation logic is duplicated across the inheritance chain, creating a latent maintenance burden. The UX surface is large (7 optional knobs) yet none are validated or normalized, so malformed requests will surface as 500-style errors instead of friendly messages. Overall the component is “fit for purpose” today, but will accrue tech debt quickly if more chat-like tools are added.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Hidden Schema Duplication & Inheritance Mismatch\n**Insight:** `get_input_schema()` (lines 95-158) completely bypasses the automatic schema builder provided by `SimpleTool`, copying boiler-plate JSON Schema by hand.  \n**Evidence:** 60-line manual schema vs. the unused `get_tool_fields()` (lines 164-187) that was designed to eliminate this duplication.  \n**Impact:** Any future change to common fields (temperature range, model enum, etc.) must be edited in every tool that overrides the schema—violates DRY and risks drift.  \n**Recommendation:** Delete the override; move description constants into class attributes and let the base class assemble the schema.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; High payoff (prevents silent inconsistencies).\n\n### 2. UX Complexity Without Validation\n**Insight:** Six optional parameters (`model`, `temperature`, `thinking_mode`, `use_websearch`, `continuation_id`, `files`, `images`) are accepted but never validated or normalized.  \n**Evidence:** `ChatRequest` (lines 42-47) only declares `prompt` as required; no Pydantic validators for file existence, image format, or enum casing.  \n**Impact:** Users receive low-level Python or OpenAI errors instead of actionable messages; support burden grows as the tool is embedded in more clients.  \n**Recommendation:** Add Pydantic validators (`@validator`) that coerce enums, check file readability, and emit concise human-readable errors.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (robust UX).\n\n### 3. Temperature & Thinking-Mode Interference\n**Insight:** Both `temperature` (line 123) and `thinking_mode` (line 129) influence randomness/depth but are orthogonal in the schema.  \n**Evidence:** No logic maps a high-thinking request to a lower temperature or vice-versa; users can set `temperature=1` + `thinking_mode=max`, producing erratic long outputs.  \n**Impact:** Model behavior becomes unpredictable for downstream consumers that log or regression-test responses.  \n**Recommendation:** Either (a) document the interaction clearly or (b) derive temperature automatically from thinking_mode when not explicitly set.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (predictable outputs).\n\n### 4. File & Image Path Handling Is Unsafe\n**Insight:** `files` and `images` accept “FULL absolute paths” but are later read by a helper that is not shown; no guard against `/etc/passwd` or 2 GB binaries.  \n**Evidence:** Descriptions on lines 34 & 37 demand absolute paths, implying later file-system access.  \n**Impact:** Directory traversal or accidental upload of secrets is possible if the tool is exposed outside a fully-trusted client.  \n**Recommendation:** Validate paths against an allow-list/root folder; size-cap and mime-check before reading.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (security).\n\n### 5. Hard-Coded “AGENT’S TURN” Footer\n**Insight:** `format_response()` (lines 205-212) appends a fixed string instructing the agent to “continue with the user’s request”.  \n**Evidence:** Literal text baked into every response.  \n**Impact:** If the tool is used in a non-agentic context (e.g., a Slack bot) the footer is nonsensical and leaks implementation detail.  \n**Recommendation:** Make the footer optional via class attribute or omit it entirely; let the orchestration layer decide next steps.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (cleaner API surface).\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Replace the 60-line `get_input_schema()` override with the inherited auto-builder.  \n- Add Pydantic `@validator` for `thinking_mode`, `temperature`, and file existence.  \n- Cap `temperature` granularity to two decimals to avoid floating-point drift in logs.  \n- Move `CHAT_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS` into class-level `Field()` definitions to keep schema and description together.\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. Consolidate all “chat-style” tools (chat, code-review, doc-writer) into a single `ChatService` that accepts a `persona` parameter—eliminates N near-identical subclasses.  \n2.

Critical Security Vulnerabilities in File/Image Handling\n**Insight:** The tool accepts absolute file paths and base64 images without validation, creating severe security risks including directory traversal and resource exhaustion attacks.\n**Evidence:** \n- Line 34: `files` field requires \"FULL absolute paths\" without sanitization\n- Line 37: `images` accepts base64 data without size/type validation\n**Impact:** Could enable unauthorized file access, system crashes via large payloads, or injection attacks through malformed images.\n**Recommendation:** Implement path validation to restrict access to allowed directories, enforce size limits for base64 images, and add file type verification.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; Critical payoff (prevents security breaches)\n\n### 2. Performance Risks from Unbounded Context Inputs\n**Insight:** No constraints exist on file/image quantities or sizes, creating scalability bottlenecks and instability risks.\n**Evidence:** \n- Lines 46-47: `files` and `images` use unbounded lists without size limits\n- No async processing for large file operations\n**Impact:** Large inputs could cause memory exhaustion, slow response times, or service crashes under load.\n**Recommendation:** Add configurable limits for file counts/sizes and implement async processing for large file operations.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (improves stability and scalability)\n\n### 3. Maintainability Debt from Manual Schema Override\n**Insight:** The 64-line manual schema override creates fragility and technical debt by duplicating functionality available in the base class.\n**Evidence:** \n- Lines 95-158: Entire `get_input_schema()` manually reimplements base class functionality\n- Lines 161-192: Commented alternative implementation adds confusion\n**Impact:** Increases maintenance burden, risks schema drift from base class updates, and complicates future enhancements.\n**Recommendation:** Migrate to base class's automatic schema generation after establishing versioned compatibility.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (reduces technical debt)\n\n### 4. Operational Gaps in Observability and Error Handling\n**Insight:** The tool lacks logging, metrics, and error handling for critical operations, making production troubleshooting difficult.\n**Evidence:** \n- No logging statements in any methods\n- `format_response()` (lines 205-212) has no error handling\n- File/image processing lacks failure visibility\n**Impact:** Operational issues may go undetected, and debugging becomes challenging during failures.\n**Recommendation:** Add structured logging for file access, image processing, and web search operations with error tracking.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (improves operational visibility)\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Remove commented code (lines 161-192) to reduce clutter\n- Add basic size validation for base64 images (e.g., reject >10MB payloads)\n- Implement path validation to prevent directory traversal (e.g., restrict to project directories)\n- Add logging for file access attempts and web search usage\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Security Hardening Phase**: Implement comprehensive input validation across all file/image operations\n2. **Observability Integration**: Add metrics and distributed tracing for all tool operations\n3. **Schema Modernization**: Migrate from manual schema override to base class automation with versioned compatibility\n4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement streaming for large file processing and async image handling\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate Security Patch**: Implement file path validation and image size checks within 1 sprint\n2. **Code Cleanup**: Remove commented code and add basic logging in the next release\n3. **Performance Testing**: Conduct load testing with large file sets to establish safe operational limits\n4. **Observability Plan**: Define key metrics and logging requirements for production monitoring",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe codereview tool is a well-structured workflow orchestrator that successfully enforces systematic investigation patterns, but exhibits architectural over-engineering through excessive configuration layers, brittle inheritance hierarchies, and speculative complexity that will impede long-term maintainability. While the step-wise enforcement mechanism is sound, the codebase suffers from premature abstraction and configuration explosion that increases onboarding friction without proportional benefit.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Configuration Explosion & Over-Engineering\n**Insight:** 120-line field description dictionary (lines 36-120) and 200-line schema override (lines 243-317) create unnecessary complexity for a workflow tool.\n**Evidence:** `CODEREVIEW_WORKFLOW_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS` duplicates pydantic Field descriptions; `codereview_field_overrides` rebuilds schema information already available via introspection.\n**Impact:** New developers must understand 3 layers (pydantic → descriptions → overrides) to make simple field changes; 3x increase in maintenance surface.\n**Recommendation:** Eliminate description dictionary and schema overrides; rely on pydantic's native Field descriptions and automatic schema generation.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; High payoff (60% code reduction in configuration layer)\n\n### 2. Brittle Inheritance Hierarchy\n**Insight:** Deep inheritance chain (BaseTool → WorkflowTool → CodeReviewTool) with 18 hook methods creates tight coupling and hidden dependencies.\n**Evidence:** Methods like `get_completion_status()` (line 504) return magic strings; `prepare_work_summary()` (line 537) depends on parent class implementation details.\n**Impact:** Refactoring base classes risks breaking all workflow tools; new workflow types must implement 18+ hook methods correctly.\n**Recommendation:** Introduce composition over inheritance - create WorkflowBehavior interface that tools can implement selectively.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (decoupled architecture, easier testing)\n\n### 3. Speculative Flexibility Features\n**Insight:** Confidence-based workflow optimization (lines 98-107) and expert analysis bypass logic (lines 492-496) solve problems that don't exist yet.\n**Evidence:** 7-level confidence enum with \"almost_certain\" vs \"certain\" distinction; complex bypass logic for expert analysis based on confidence.\n**Impact:** Adds cognitive overhead for CLI agents who must understand subtle confidence differences; code paths that may never be used.\n**Recommendation:** Simplify to 3 levels (low/medium/high) and remove bypass logic - always perform expert analysis for consistency.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (simplified UX, reduced bug surface)\n\n### 4. State Management Fragility\n**Insight:** Tool instance stores request state (`initial_request`, `review_config` lines 191-192) creating potential for cross-request contamination.\n**Evidence:** Instance variables persist between calls; no cleanup mechanism visible; could leak data between review sessions.\n**Impact:** Race conditions in concurrent usage; difficult-to-debug state bugs in production.\n**Recommendation:** Make tools stateless - pass all required data through request parameters or use request-scoped context objects.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (eliminates entire class of bugs)\n\n### 5. Magic String Proliferation\n**Insight:** 15+ magic strings for statuses and keys scattered throughout codebase create hidden coupling.\n**Evidence:** \"code_review_complete_ready_for_implementation\" (line 506), \"complete_code_review\" (line 510), various status mappings (lines 658-663).\n**Impact:** Typos cause silent failures; refactoring requires global search/replace; no compile-time validation.\n**Recommendation:** Centralize all constants in enum classes; use type-safe status representations.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (reduced error rate, easier refactoring)\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Replace 120-line description dictionary with direct pydantic Field descriptions\n- Extract magic strings into centralized constants/enums\n- Remove unused temperature/thinking_mode fields (lines 167-169)\n- Simplify confidence enum from 7 to 3 levels\n- Add docstring examples showing minimal viable implementation\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1:** Eliminate configuration duplication and magic strings\n2. **Phase 2:** Refactor inheritance to composition-based architecture\n3. **Phase 3:** Implement stateless design with request-scoped context\n4. **Phase 4:** Extract common workflow patterns into reusable components\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate:** Create PR removing description dictionary and schema overrides (saves 200+ lines)\n2. **This Sprint:** Implement stateless design to eliminate cross-request contamination risk\n3. **Next Quarter:** Refactor to composition-based architecture for better extensibility\n\nThe tool's core workflow enforcement mechanism is sound, but the surrounding architecture suffers from premature optimization and speculative complexity that will hinder rather than help future development.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe codereview tool demonstrates sophisticated workflow engineering with systematic investigation capabilities, but suffers from significant over-engineering that introduces instability risks and UX complexity. While its structured approach to code review is architecturally sound, the excessive abstraction layers, verbose configuration, and rigid state management create maintainability burdens and potential failure points. The tool's strength lies in its comprehensive analysis framework, but its complexity may outweigh benefits for typical use cases.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Over-Engineering Through Excessive Abstraction\n**Insight:** The tool introduces unnecessary complexity through multiple abstraction layers and verbose configuration without clear current need.\n**Evidence:** \n- 20+ fields in `CodeReviewRequest` (lines 123-176) with extensive descriptions, many overlapping in purpose\n- Manual schema building in `get_input_schema()` (lines 238-325) duplicating Pydantic model definitions\n- Multiple state tracking mechanisms: `consolidated_findings`, `initial_request`, `review_config`, and confidence levels\n**Impact:** High cognitive load for maintainers, steep learning curve for users, and increased surface area for bugs. The complexity slows onboarding and makes modifications risky.\n**Recommendation:** Simplify by consolidating related fields (e.g., merge `files_checked` and `relevant_files`), leverage Pydantic's native schema generation, and reduce optional configuration parameters.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort, High payoff (significant maintainability improvement)\n\n### 2. Brittle Workflow State Management\n**Insight:** Distributed state logic and manual step progression create multiple failure points.\n**Evidence:**\n- Step validation only occurs in initial step (lines 172-176), leaving later steps vulnerable to invalid states\n- Confidence progression logic scattered across `get_required_actions()` (lines 327-367) and `get_code_review_step_guidance()` (lines 581-637)\n- Backtracking feature (`backtrack_from_step`, lines 108-111) lacks error recovery mechanisms\n**Impact:** Risk of workflow corruption, inconsistent results, and difficult debugging. State inconsistencies could cause silent failures or incorrect expert analysis triggers.\n**Recommendation:** Implement a centralized state machine with comprehensive validation for all transitions. Add explicit error recovery paths and state consistency checks.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff (improved stability)\n\n### 3. UX Complexity Through Aggressive Workflow Enforcement\n**Insight:** Mandatory pauses and recursive calls create disruptive user experience.\n**Evidence:**\n- Tool description emphasizes \"forced pauses\" and \"MUST investigate before calling again\" (lines 208-212)\n- Guidance messages use aggressive language: \"MANDATORY\", \"CRITICAL AWARENESS\", \"STOP!\" (lines 599-635)\n- Users must manage multiple concepts simultaneously: step numbers, confidence levels, file lists, and issue tracking\n**Impact:** High cognitive load leads to user errors, incomplete reviews, or tool abandonment. The rigid workflow interrupts natural review processes.\n**Recommendation:** Provide optional guidance rather than mandatory pauses. Introduce a \"quick review\" mode for experienced users. Use collaborative language instead of directives.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff (improved adoption)\n\n### 4. Inefficient Expert Analysis Integration\n**Insight:** Expert analysis triggers are ambiguous and context preparation is redundant.\n**Evidence:**\n- Vague criteria in `should_call_expert_analysis()` (lines 369-384) with arbitrary thresholds\n- Context building in `prepare_expert_analysis_context()` (lines 386-431) duplicates information already in workflow state\n- Subjective confidence levels (lines 98-107) with unclear progression criteria\n**Impact:** Unnecessary external API calls, increased costs, and inconsistent review quality. Users may prematurely skip expert analysis or trigger it inappropriately.\n**Recommendation:** Define objective, data-driven criteria for expert analysis. Streamline context preparation to avoid duplication. Provide clear confidence progression guidelines.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff (cost optimization)\n\n### 5. Tight Coupling to Workflow Framework\n**Insight:** Heavy inheritance and framework-specific overrides limit flexibility.\n**Evidence:**\n- 16 method overrides (lines 472-688) customizing base workflow behavior\n- Extensive response mapping in `customize_workflow_response()` (lines 639-688)\n- Direct dependency on framework concepts like `consolidated_findings` and `WorkflowSchemaBuilder`\n**Impact:** Difficult to adapt to new requirements or integrate with other systems. Framework changes could break the implementation.\n**Recommendation:** Introduce adapter patterns to decouple code review logic from workflow framework. Reduce inheritance depth and favor composition.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort, Medium payoff (improved maintainability)\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Simplify field descriptions in `CODEREVIEW_WORKFLOW_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS` (lines 36-120) by removing redundant explanations\n- Replace aggressive guidance language with collaborative phrasing (e.g., \"Please consider\" instead of \"MANDATORY\")\n- Add basic validation for confidence levels and step numbers to prevent invalid states\n- Consolidate duplicate field definitions between Pydantic model and schema builder\n- Implement a \"quick start\" mode bypassing optional workflow steps\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1: Simplification** - Reduce optional fields, consolidate state management, and streamline workflow\n2. **Phase 2: Decoupling** - Introduce service layers to separate code review logic from workflow framework\n3. **Phase 3: UX Enhancement** - Develop flexible workflows with optional guidance and progressive disclosure\n4. **Phase 4: Extensibility** - Design plugin architecture for custom review rules and integrations\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Conduct user research to identify essential vs. over-engineered features\n2. Prototype a simplified version with reduced complexity and gather feedback\n3. Implement state machine pattern for centralized workflow control\n4. Develop clear, objective criteria for expert analysis triggers to optimize efficiency",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview  \nThe consensus tool is a well-intentioned multi-model “committee” workflow, but it couples orchestration, prompt templating, model I/O, and state management into one 900-line class. The design is **synchronous-by-nature** (one model at a time), **stateful-by-default** (instance variables mutated on every step), and **chatty-over-the-wire** (every step is a fresh MCP call that must re-transmit the entire accumulated history). These traits create a trifecta of **scalability bottlenecks**, **runtime fragility**, and **user-experience complexity** that will worsen as model count, payload size, or invocation rate grows. The code is readable and unit-tested, yet the macro-architecture is not ready for production traffic or long-term feature evolution without a phased refactor.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Stateful Singleton Orchestrator\n**Insight:** The tool inherits from `WorkflowTool` but keeps **all progress in `self.*` instance variables** (`models_to_consult`, `accumulated_responses`, `original_proposal`, …).  \n**Evidence:** Lines 167-171, 442, 472-473, 487.  \n**Impact:**  \n- Concurrent users overwrite each other’s state → non-deterministic results.  \n- Horizontal scaling (multiple replicas) is impossible without sticky sessions.  \n- A crash between steps loses the entire workflow—no recovery path.  \n**Recommendation:** Persist workflow state in an external, versioned store (Redis, Dynamo, Postgres) keyed by a short-lived `workflow_id` passed in every MCP request.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High.\n\n### 2. Chatty Synchronous Model Fan-out\n**Insight:** Models are consulted **sequentially inside the same MCP invocation** (line 484). Each step waits for the previous model to finish.  \n**Evidence:** `execute_workflow` loop lines 478-555.  \n**Impact:**  \n- Latency grows **linearly** with model count (4 models ≈ 4× latency).  \n- Down-stream providers are idle while peer models run—wastes quota & money.  \n- Users stare at a spinner for minutes on multi-model debates.  \n**Recommendation:** Fire models in **parallel** with `asyncio.gather` (or a job queue) and stream partial results back via Server-Sent Events or WebSocket.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High.\n\n### 3. Payload Amplification & Network Churn\n**Insight:** Every step re-uploads **all accumulated responses** as JSON text (line 554). A 5-model, 4 kB response each becomes 20 kB on step 5—**quadratic growth**.  \n**Evidence:** `json.dumps(response_data, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)`.  \n**Impact:**  \n- MCP message size balloons → hitting LLM context window or gRPC/HTTP limits.  \n- Slower UI renders, especially over CLI or mobile SSH.  \n**Recommendation:** Return only **deltas** (`model_id`, `stance`, `verdict`) plus a `workflow_id`; let the client pull full history when needed.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium.\n\n### 4. Hidden Router Coupling & Runtime Fail-fast\n**Insight:** Step-1 pre-flight (line 643-714) **blocks the entire workflow** if any model is unavailable.  \n**Evidence:** `unavailable` list → `ValueError` raised.  \n**Impact:**  \n- A single deprecated model name aborts a 10-minute consensus.  \n- No graceful degradation (skip & annotate, or fallback to “neutral” stance).  \n**Recommendation:** Convert hard fails into **warnings**; allow optional “best-effort” mode that continues with available models.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High.\n\n### 5. Over-engineered Prompt Templating\n**Insight:** 200-line `_get_stance_enhanced_prompt` duplicates ethical guardrails already present in system cards.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 723-791.  \n**Impact:**  \n- Prompts drift out of sync with model provider updates.  \n- Token burn increases cost.  \n**Recommendation:** Replace stance injection with a **single meta-instruction** (“You are asked to argue FOR/AGAINST the following…”) and let the model’s native alignment handle ethics.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium.\n\n### 6. File-Context Leakage Risk\n**Insight:** Temporary `ModelContext` is attached to `self` then explicitly deleted (lines 576-594), but any exception between 579-586 leaves `_model_context` alive.  \n**Evidence:** `try/finally` pattern is correct yet fragile under future edits.  \n**Impact:**  \n- Could leak file handles or auth tokens across model calls.  \n**Recommendation:** Use `",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview  \nThe consensus tool demonstrates a sophisticated multi-model workflow architecture with strong separation of concerns and extensible design. However, it exhibits critical risks in state management complexity, sequential processing bottlenecks, and framework coupling that could impede scalability and maintainability. While its stance-based analysis and blinded consensus approach are architecturally sound, the implementation's stateful nature and lack of parallelization pose significant challenges for production workloads.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Stateful Design Creates Concurrency Risks\n**Insight**: Instance variables store workflow state across steps, making the tool non-reentrant and unsafe for concurrent executions.  \n**Evidence**:  \n```python\n# Lines 167-171: Persistent instance state\nself.initial_prompt: str | None = None\nself.original_proposal: str | None = None\nself.models_to_consult: list[dict] = []\nself.accumulated_responses: list[dict] = []\n```  \n**Impact**: Concurrent workflow executions will corrupt state, causing data leakage and incorrect results. This fundamentally limits scalability in multi-user environments.  \n**Recommendation**: Refactor to a stateless design by encapsulating workflow state in a dedicated `ConsensusState` object passed between steps. Use dependency injection for state management.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit**: High effort, High payoff (enables safe concurrency).\n\n### 2. Sequential Model Processing Bottleneck\n**Insight**: Models are consulted sequentially without parallelization, creating linear time complexity relative to model count.  \n**Evidence**:  \n```python\n# Lines 478-484: Sequential consultation loop\nif request.step_number <= request.total_steps:\n    model_idx = request.step_number - 1\n    if model_idx < len(self.models_to_consult):\n        model_response = await self._consult_model(...)  # Blocking call\n```  \n**Impact**: With 5 models taking 10s each, consensus requires 50s minimum. This UX bottleneck makes the tool impractical for real-time decisions or large model sets.  \n**Recommendation**: Implement parallel model consultations using `asyncio.gather()`. Add configurable concurrency limits and timeout controls.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit**: Medium effort, High payoff (10x+ speed improvement).\n\n### 3. Framework Coupling Hinders Testability\n**Insight**: Tight coupling with `ModelProviderRegistry`, `ModelContext`, and hidden model routing creates opaque dependencies.  \n**Evidence**:  \n```python\n# Lines 668-682: Hidden model routing complexity\nhidden_enabled = os.getenv(\"HIDDEN_MODEL_ROUTER_ENABLED\", \"true\") == \"true\"\nif hidden_enabled and name.strip().lower() in sentinels:\n    from providers.registry import ModelProviderRegistry as _Reg\n    routed = _Reg.get_preferred_fallback_model(None)\n```  \n**Impact**: Unit testing requires mocking complex framework internals. Environment-dependent behavior reduces deployment consistency.  \n**Recommendation**: Extract model resolution into a strategy pattern with injectable provider. Replace environment flags with explicit configuration.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit**: Medium effort, Medium payoff (improves test coverage).\n\n### 4. Error Handling Lacks Recovery Pathways\n**Insight**: Model consultation failures return error dictionaries but don't halt workflows or enable retries.  \n**Evidence**:  \n```python\n# Lines 623-641: Silent failure handling\nexcept Exception as e:\n    return {\n        \"model\": model_config.get(\"model\", \"unknown\"),\n        \"status\": \"error\",\n        \"error\": str(e),\n    }\n```  \n**Impact**: Failed model responses are treated as valid inputs, leading to incomplete consensus without user awareness.  \n**Recommendation**: Implement circuit breakers for model calls. Add retry policies with exponential backoff. Provide explicit failure modes in workflow status.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit**: Low effort, High payoff (prevents flawed decisions).\n\n### 5. Verbose Stance Prompts Create Maintenance Overhead\n**Insight**: 200+ line stance prompts are hardcoded, making customization and maintenance cumbersome.  \n**Evidence**:  \n```python\n# Lines 724-787: Embedded stance prompts\nstance_prompts = {\n    \"for\": \"\"\"SUPPORTIVE PERSPECTIVE WITH INTEGRITY\n    MANDATORY ETHICAL CONSTRAINTS: ... [200+ lines] ...\"\"\",\n    \"against\": \"\"\"CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE WITH RESPONSIBILITY ...\"\"\",\n}\n```  \n**Impact**: Prompt changes require code deployments. Versioning and A/B testing stance behaviors is impractical.  \n**Recommendation**: Externalize prompts to configurable templates (e.g., Jinja2 in YAML). Support prompt overrides per workflow instance.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit**: Low effort, Medium payoff (improves agility).\n\n## Quick Wins\n- **Add State Validation**: Check for state corruption before each step (e.g., verify `original_proposal` matches initial input in step 2+).  \n- **Implement Request Timeouts**: Add timeout parameters to `_consult_model` (line 604) to prevent indefinite hangs.  \n- **Simplify Metadata Duplication**: Consolidate `_customize_consensus_metadata` and `_add_workflow_metadata` (lines 812-889) into a single method.  \n- **Add Model Health Checks**: Pre-validate model availability in `_preflight_validate_step_one` (line 643) using lightweight ping calls.  \n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Stateless Workflow Engine**: Migrate to a stateless architecture where workflow state is serialized between steps, enabling horizontal scaling.  \n2. **Consensus Caching Layer**: Implement prompt/response caching to avoid redundant model calls for identical proposals.  \n3. **Pluggable Stance System**: Create a stance registry allowing custom stance behaviors via plugins.  \n4. **Observability Suite**: Add structured logging, metrics for model latency, and consensus success rates.  \n\n## Next Steps  \n1. **Prioritize State Management Refactor**: Begin by extracting state into a dedicated `ConsensusSession` class to eliminate instance variables.  \n2. **Prototype Parallel Execution**: Implement a proof-of-concept for concurrent model consultations using `asyncio.gather()`.  \n3. **Enhance Error Resilience**: Add circuit breakers and retry policies before scaling to production workloads.  \n\nThese changes will transform the tool from a functional prototype into a scalable, production-ready consensus system while preserving its innovative stance-based analysis approach.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview  \nThe debug tool is a well-intentioned attempt to codify a disciplined, hypothesis-driven investigation workflow. It succeeds in forcing agents to pause, collect evidence, and back-track when dead-ends appear. However, the implementation is over-engineered: 650+ lines of mostly string templating, brittle state machines, and hard-coded confidence heuristics that will drift out of sync with real-world usage. The UX surface is enormous (25+ optional fields, 7 confidence levels, 4 step archetypes) and the tight coupling to a single-file inheritance tree makes future evolution expensive. The architecture is serviceable for a narrow internal audience today, but will become a maintenance tax as soon as the team needs multi-turn parallelism, streaming, or human-in-the-loop review.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Over-Specified DSL for Prompting  \n**Insight:** 115 lines of prose frozen in Python constants (`DEBUG_INVESTIGATION_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS`) duplicate what the LLM already knows about debugging.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 35-114 contain 4 000+ characters of micro-instructions such as “CRITICAL: Remember that reported symptoms might originate from code far from where they manifest.”  \n**Impact:** Every tweak to phrasing requires a code change, review, and redeploy; the prompt cannot be A/B-tested or personalised without a release.  \n**Recommendation:** Collapse to a one-sentence field hint and move the long-form coaching into a versioned system-prompt file or prompt-management service.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff (faster iteration, non-engineers can tune voice).\n\n### 2. Confidence Enumeration Proliferation  \n**Insight:** Seven ordinal confidence buckets (`exploring` → `certain`) are manually mapped to behaviour in a dozen places; the distinctions are subjective and will not survive contact with heterogeneous models.  \n**Evidence:** `get_required_actions()` (lines 279-320) and `should_call_expert_analysis()` (lines 322-337) both re-implement the same ladder; `certain` short-circuits expert review (line 513) creating a blind spot.  \n**Impact:** Agents will game the level that gives the fastest path; “certain” becomes a cheat code to skip oversight, reducing debug quality.  \n**Recommendation:** Replace with a continuous 0-1 score and let the orchestrator decide when to escalate; keep a single threshold knob in config.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff (simpler code, better telemetry, model-agnostic).\n\n### 3. State Machine Hidden in String Templates  \n**Insight:** Workflow progression is enforced by injecting ever-longer “MANDATORY: DO NOT call … again yet” strings instead of immutable state flags.  \n**Evidence:** `get_step_guidance()` returns natural-language orders (lines 436-486) that the consuming agent must parse and obey; there is no programmatic gate.  \n**Impact:** A mildly creative agent can ignore the prose and loop forever; failures will be detected only by human review or token-quota alarms.  \n**Recommendation:** Expose a boolean `can_proceed` flag in the response schema and let the orchestrator hard-block recursive calls.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff (robust loop prevention, clearer metrics).\n\n### 4. Monolithic Inheritance Tree  \n**Insight:** All workflow variants (debug, refactor, test, etc.) inherit from `WorkflowTool`, which in turn inherits from `BaseTool`; each leaf class re-implements the same 10–12 hook methods with minor string changes.  \n**Evidence:** `DebugIssueTool` overrides 15 hook methods just to rename JSON keys (`investigation_status`, `complete_investigation`, …).  \n**Impact:** Cross-cutting changes (e.g., adding telemetry) require touching every subclass; newcomers must learn the subtle differences between `get_completion_status()` and `get_completion_data_key()`.  \n**Recommendation:** Compose behaviour with small policy objects (strategy pattern) and keep tool classes to <200 lines.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort, High payoff (accelerates future tools, reduces merge conflicts).\n\n### 5. File-Content Loading Inside Prompt Builder  \n**Insight:** `prepare_expert_analysis_context()` (lines 387-395) reads arbitrary files from disk and embeds them in the prompt at full length, with no size cap or token budget.  \n**Evidence:** `_prepare_file_content_for_prompt()` is called unconditionally for every path in `relevant_files`.  \n**Impact:** A single 2 MB log file will blow the context window, crash the call, and stall the debugging session; no pagination or summarisation fallback exists.  \n**Recommendation:** Wrap file loading behind a tokenizer-aware service that truncates, summarises, or prompts for explicit user consent beyond a threshold.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe debug tool implements a sophisticated structured investigation workflow with strong architectural foundations, but exhibits significant complexity through extensive customization layers and rigid enforcement patterns. While its systematic approach to root cause analysis is well-designed for complex debugging scenarios, the implementation carries maintainability risks due to deep framework coupling and cognitive overhead from numerous overrides. The tool's confidence-based workflow and comprehensive tracking mechanisms are standout strengths, though UX friction from mandatory pauses and potential performance bottlenecks in file processing require strategic attention.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Architectural Over-Engineering Through Excessive Customization\n**Insight:** The debug tool exhibits over-engineering via 20+ method overrides and complex state management, creating unnecessary cognitive load and fragility.\n**Evidence:** `DebugIssueTool` (lines 154-655) contains extensive overrides including `get_input_schema`, `customize_workflow_response`, and `get_step_guidance_message`. Status mapping logic (lines 617-645) manually converts generic workflow concepts to debug-specific terms, while state like `self.initial_issue` (line 166) introduces implicit coupling.\n**Impact:** High maintenance burden - changes to base workflow framework risk breaking debug functionality. New developers face steep learning curve due to scattered customization logic. Violates DRY principle through repeated status/field mappings.\n**Recommendation:** Extract debug-specific behaviors into strategy classes (e.g., `DebugResponseFormatter`, `InvestigationOrchestrator`) using composition over inheritance. Consolidate status/field mappings into configuration-driven approaches.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort, High payoff (reduces fragility and improves onboarding).\n\n### 2. Performance Risk in File Processing Pipeline\n**Insight:** Unbounded file content embedding during expert analysis preparation creates scalability bottlenecks.\n**Evidence:** `prepare_expert_analysis_context` (lines 339-397) calls `_prepare_file_content_for_prompt` (line 389) without size limits. The method processes all `relevant_files` (line 388) with no truncation or summarization logic, risking token overflow in large codebases.\n**Impact:** Memory exhaustion and API timeouts when debugging large projects. Degrades user experience through slow responses. Potential cost overruns from excessive LLM token usage.\n**Recommendation:** Implement intelligent file chunking with relevance scoring. Add configurable token limits and priority-based content inclusion (e.g., focus on `relevant_context` methods first).\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff (prevents production failures).\n\n### 3. UX Friction from Rigid Workflow Enforcement\n**Insight:** Mandatory step pauses and verbose guidance create unnecessary friction for experienced users.\n**Evidence:** Step guidance methods (lines 427-487) use imperative language like \"MANDATORY: DO NOT call debug tool again\" (line 438) and \"STOP! Do NOT call debug again yet\" (line 449). The tool description (lines 182-186) emphasizes enforcement over flexibility.\n**Impact:** Reduces tool adoption for simple debugging tasks. Frustrates power users who prefer direct control. Increases investigation time unnecessarily for straightforward issues.\n**Recommendation:** Introduce \"expert mode\" bypassing mandatory pauses. Add adaptive guidance based on issue complexity inferred from initial description. Allow step consolidation for high-confidence scenarios.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff (improves user satisfaction).\n\n### 4. Brittle Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms\n**Insight:** Critical operations lack error handling, risking investigation state corruption.\n**Evidence:** File operations in `_prepare_file_content_for_prompt` (line 389) and external model calls in `should_call_expert_analysis` (lines 322-337) have no try-catch blocks. No recovery mechanisms exist for failed investigation steps.\n**Impact:** Unhandled exceptions crash investigations, losing user progress. Inconsistent tool behavior under failure conditions reduces trust in debugging outcomes.\n**Recommendation:** Add defensive programming around file I/O and external API calls. Implement investigation checkpointing and rollback capabilities. Provide clear error recovery paths.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff (improves reliability).\n\n### 5. Ambiguous Expert Analysis Trigger Criteria\n**Insight:** Over-reliance on external model validation without clear necessity thresholds.\n**Evidence:** `should_call_expert_analysis` (lines 322-337) uses simplistic heuristics (file count, finding length) without considering issue complexity. The method lacks cost/benefit analysis for external validation.\n**Impact:** Unnecessary external model calls increase latency and costs. Inconsistent validation quality when expert analysis is triggered for trivial issues.\n**Recommendation:** Implement complexity scoring based on factors like codebase size, error type, and hypothesis confidence. Add cost-aware thresholds for external validation.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff (optimizes resource usage).\n\n## Quick Wins\n- **Add file path validation:** Prevent runtime errors by validating `files_checked` and `relevant_files` paths before processing\n- **Implement investigation logging:** Add structured logging at key workflow stages for debugging the tool itself\n- **Simplify confidence levels:** Consolidate \"very_high\" and \"almost_certain\" (lines 98-104) to reduce cognitive overhead\n- **Add progress indicators:** Visual step tracking (e.g., \"Step 2/5\") to improve user orientation during long investigations\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Modularization Phase (3-6 months):** Extract debug-specific logic into dedicated services, reducing class complexity by 40%\n2. **Performance Optimization (6-9 months):** Implement intelligent file processing with token-aware chunking and caching\n3. **UX Enhancement (9-12 months):** Develop adaptive workflow modes supporting both guided and expert debugging experiences\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Prioritize refactoring:** Start with extracting status mapping logic (lines 617-645) into a dedicated formatter class to immediately reduce coupling\n2. **Implement defensive programming:** Add error handling around file operations and external API calls within 2 sprints\n3. **Conduct user interviews:** Validate UX friction points with actual debug tool users to guide adaptive workflow design\n\nThis analysis reveals a functionally powerful but architecturally complex tool requiring strategic refactoring to maintain long-term viability. The recommendations focus on reducing cognitive load while preserving the tool's core strength in systematic investigation workflows.",

While it enforces disciplined, file-by-file coverage and provides rich configuration knobs, the implementation is over-engineered: 650+ lines of mostly boiler-plate, inheritance hooks, and string templating that duplicate base-class behaviour, creating a high maintenance surface with no clear runtime benefit. The UX is also high-friction—users must walk through N+1 discrete steps—and the tool has no visibility into nested directories, multi-language repos, or existing doc generators (Sphinx, Javadoc, DocC, etc.), limiting its usefulness at scale.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Excessive Configuration & Inheritance Layers\n**Insight:** 40+ field descriptors, 15+ hook methods, and a 300-line schema builder are used to describe a simple “discover → document each file → finish” flow.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 38-114 (field text), 224-301 (schema builder), 518-647 (hook overrides).  \n**Impact:** Onboarding cost rises (devs must learn the meta-framework), and every future change touches multiple mirrored definitions.  \n**Recommendation:** Collapse to a single Pydantic model with plain field descriptions; drop all hook overrides that merely rename keys.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff.\n\n### 2. Single-Directory Restriction\n**Insight:** Required actions (lines 308-318) explicitly limit discovery to “current directory (not nested)”, silently ignoring sub-modules.  \n**Evidence:** “Discover ALL files in the current directory (not nested)”.  \n**Impact:** Any real-world repo will need manual iteration per folder or external scripting, defeating the “automated” claim.  \n**Recommendation:** Replace flat glob with `pathlib.rglob('*.py')` (or language-aware equivalent) and track visited paths in state.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff.\n\n### 3. High-Friction Step-wise UX\n**Insight:** Users must issue one CLI call per file (+1 discovery step); no batch or head-less mode exists.  \n**Evidence:** `get_required_actions` enforces per-file confirmation; `handle_work_completion` blocks early exit.  \n**Impact:** Docs for a 50-file package require 51 interactive prompts—unworkable in CI or large codebases.  \n**Recommendation:** Provide a `--auto` flag that loops internally and emits a single summary; keep interactive mode optional.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff.\n\n### 4. No Integration with Language Ecosystem Tools\n**Insight:** Tool hard-codes comment styles (line 45) but does not parse existing Sphinx/Google/NumPy docstrings, nor does it emit formats that `mkdocs`, `javadoc`, `swift-doc`, etc. can consume.  \n**Impact:** Generated docs live as inline comments only; no cross-references, HTML, or type-linked output.  \n**Recommendation:** Add output adapters (Markdown, reST, DocC, etc.) and ingest existing docstrings to avoid duplication.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, Medium payoff.\n\n### 5. Bug-Freeze Policy Creates Deadlock Risk\n**Insight:** Lines 69-73 mandate an immediate halt if *any* bug is spotted, waiting for user confirmation.  \n**Impact:** A one-line typo in a third-party file can block the entire documentation run; agent may loop indefinitely.  \n**Recommendation:** Log issues to a “docgen-issues.md” and continue by default; add `--halt-on-bug` opt-in flag.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff.\n\n### 6. Hidden Scalability Ceiling\n**Insight:** All file content is embedded into prompts every step; no diffing, caching, or incremental mode.  \n**Evidence:** `prepare_step_data` stuffs full file list into context each call.  \n**Impact:** O(N²) token usage; large repos will hit context limits and incur unnecessary cost.  \n**Recommendation:** Cache file hashes, document only changed files, stream diffs to the model.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort, High payoff (essential for monorepos).\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Replace flat-directory glob with recursive scan (3-line change).  \n- Add `--auto` CLI flag to skip per-step prompts; loop inside `execute_workflow`.  \n- Delete unused hook methods that only rename JSON keys (lines 518-647).  \n- Emit a single “issues-found.md” instead of hard-stopping on bugs.  \n- Document the existing JSON schema in README—users currently reverse-engineer prompts.\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. Incremental mode: store last-run git hash → doc only changed files.  \n2. Plugin architecture for language parsers (Python, TS, Swift,",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe docgen tool implements a sophisticated workflow-based documentation generation system with robust state management and comprehensive validation. However, it suffers from significant over-engineering, excessive abstraction layers, and complex state transitions that create maintainability risks. While the tool demonstrates strong architectural patterns for workflow management, its complexity introduces brittleness and high cognitive load for developers, potentially undermining its long-term viability.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Over-Engineering and Excessive Abstraction\n**Insight:** The tool exhibits severe over-engineering with unnecessary abstraction layers and configuration complexity that far exceed its core documentation generation purpose.\n**Evidence:** \n- 512 lines of code for a documentation tool with 11 overridden methods and 8 specialized helper methods\n- Complex state machine with 7 distinct step-handling branches in `get_required_actions()` (lines 303-362)\n- 76-line `DOCGEN_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS` dictionary (lines 38-114) containing repetitive configuration\n- Multiple inheritance hooks for minor behavioral variations (lines 440-646)\n**Impact:** \n- High cognitive load for new developers; steep learning curve\n- Increased risk of bugs during maintenance due to complex state interactions\n- Reduced development velocity for feature additions\n**Recommendation:** \n- Simplify the workflow by consolidating step logic into a state machine pattern\n- Extract field descriptions into a separate configuration file\n- Reduce inheritance hooks by 60% through composition over inheritance\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort, High benefit (long-term maintainability)\n\n### 2. Brittle State Management\n**Insight:** The tool relies on fragile manual counter management with complex validation logic that creates single points of failure.\n**Evidence:**\n- Critical counter validation in `handle_work_completion()` (lines 440-471) that overrides base behavior\n- Multiple counter synchronization points: `num_files_documented` and `total_files_to_document` (lines 132-133)\n- Forced continuation logic with warning logs (lines 453-467)\n- Complex counter calculations in `prepare_step_data()` (lines 473-509)\n**Impact:**\n- High risk of incomplete documentation due to counter desynchronization\n- Potential for infinite loops or premature termination\n- Difficult debugging when state becomes inconsistent\n**Recommendation:**\n- Implement an immutable state object that tracks progress automatically\n- Replace manual counters with a file-status registry pattern\n- Add comprehensive state validation at workflow boundaries\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High benefit (stability improvement)\n\n### 3. Poor Separation of Concerns\n**Insight:** The tool mixes workflow management, documentation logic, and UI guidance in a single monolithic class.\n**Evidence:**\n- Single class handling 25 distinct responsibilities (lines 144-656)\n- UI guidance embedded in business logic (`get_step_guidance_message()`, lines 599-604)\n- Response formatting mixed with core workflow (`customize_workflow_response()`, lines 606-646)\n- Configuration management intertwined with execution logic\n**Impact:**\n- Violates single responsibility principle\n- Hinders unit testing and modularity\n- Creates ripple effects during modifications\n**Recommendation:**\n- Decompose into: WorkflowEngine, DocumentationGenerator, GuidanceProvider, and ResponseFormatter\n- Extract all UI strings into external resource files\n- Implement dependency injection for configuration\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, Medium benefit (improved maintainability)\n\n### 4. UX Complexity Risks\n**Insight:** The rigid step-by-step process creates excessive cognitive overhead for users with minimal flexibility.\n**Evidence:**\n- Mandatory file-by-file processing enforced through counters (lines 448-450)\n- Repetitive \"CRITICAL\" warnings in guidance messages (lines 308, 322, 336, 350)\n- Complex step transitions with 7 distinct behavioral branches (lines 305-362)\n- No support for batch processing or parallel documentation\n**Impact:**\n- High user frustration due to inflexibility\n- Increased error rates from complex instructions\n- Poor adoption due to steep learning curve\n**Recommendation:**\n- Introduce flexible processing modes (batch, single-file, selective)\n- Simplify guidance messages by 50% focusing on essential actions\n- Add progress visualization and error recovery mechanisms\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High benefit (user experience improvement)\n\n### 5. Inefficient Resource Utilization\n**Insight:** The tool maintains excessive state and performs redundant calculations without clear benefit.\n**Evidence:**\n- Storing entire request history in `initial_request` (line 159)\n- Recalculating `total_steps` in multiple methods (lines 381, 483-488)\n- Large in-memory data structures for field descriptions\n- Unnecessary model category resolution on each call (lines 191-195)\n**Impact:**\n- Memory bloat with large documentation projects\n- Performance degradation in high-throughput scenarios\n- Increased resource consumption without functional benefit\n**Recommendation:**\n- Implement state compression and lazy loading\n- Cache calculated values like `total_steps`\n- Optimize field description storage using references\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium benefit (performance improvement)\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Extract `DOCGEN_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS` into a JSON configuration file to reduce code clutter\n- Consolidate repetitive step guidance messages into templates with parameter substitution\n- Add comprehensive logging at state transition points for debugging\n- Implement input validation for counters to prevent invalid states\n- Remove unused inheritance hooks (`should_skip_expert_analysis`, `prepare_expert_analysis_context`)\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1 (0-3 months):** Simplification and stabilization\n   - Refactor state management using immutable patterns\n   - Extract UI concerns into separate modules\n   - Implement comprehensive unit tests for state transitions\n\n2. **Phase 2 (3-6 months):** UX enhancement\n   - Develop flexible processing modes\n   - Create visual progress tracking\n   - Implement error recovery mechanisms\n\n3. **Phase 3 (6-12 months):** Performance optimization\n   - Implement parallel processing capabilities\n   - Add caching layers for repeated operations\n   - Optimize memory usage for large codebases\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate:** Conduct a focused code review to address the top 3 over-engineering issues (field descriptions, step logic, inheritance hooks)\n2. **Short-term (1-2 weeks):** Implement state management refactoring to eliminate counter synchronization risks\n3. **Medium-term (1 month):** Prototype a simplified workflow engine with clear separation of concerns\n4. **Validation:** Establish performance benchmarks and user acceptance criteria before deploying changes\n\nThe docgen tool shows strong architectural intent but requires significant simplification to achieve sustainable maintainability. The current complexity creates more problems than it solves, particularly in state management and user experience. Prioritizing the recommended refactoring will yield substantial long-term benefits in stability and developer productivity.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe HealthTool is a lightweight, single-purpose diagnostic endpoint that surfaces runtime state (configured providers, model list, recent log tails) without external dependencies or side-effects.  \nIts design is admirably minimal, but it is fragile under real-world ops load: blocking I/O, no size/time guards on log reads, silent failure swallowing, and no caching or back-pressure for large logs. These issues are tolerable while the server is a dev-time MCP bridge, yet they become availability and UX liabilities once the service is embedded in customer-facing workflows or high-throughput automation.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Blocking I/O in Async Context\n**Insight:** `run()` (line 61) and `_tail_file()` (line 50) perform synchronous disk reads inside the async `execute()` path (line 87).  \n**Evidence:** `path.open(\"r\").readlines()` on line 55 blocks the event-loop for the duration of the read.  \n**Impact:** Under concurrent health probes (or large log files) the single-threaded asyncio loop stalls, inflating P99 latency and triggering false-positive “unhealthy” verdicts from upstream load-balancers.  \n**Recommendation:** Convert `_tail_file()` to `aiofiles` or pre-read logs in a thread pool; cap file size and line count.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff (immediate latency & stability win).\n\n### 2. Silent Failure Swallowing\n**Insight:** All file and registry exceptions are caught and ignored (lines 58, 100-102).  \n**Evidence:** `except Exception: return []` and `except Exception as e: … str(e)` return opaque JSON with no stack trace or structured code.  \n**Impact:** Operators lose visibility into mis-configured env vars, permission errors, or corrupted JSONL files; downstream dashboards show “healthy” while the server is partially blind.  \n**Recommendation:** Log structured errors with `logger.exception()` and expose a numeric “health_status” field (0/1) so callers can distinguish “healthy” from “degraded”.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff (observability & debuggability).\n\n### 3. Unbounded Log Tail\n**Insight:** `tail_lines` defaults to 50 but is not capped; callers may request 10 000 lines (line 62).  \n**Evidence:** No upper bound check before `lines[-n:]` slice on line 57.  \n**Impact:** A single malicious or mis-programmed client can allocate hundreds of MB, exhaust memory, and crash the MCP server.  \n**Recommendation:** Enforce `max_tail=500` in schema and clamp input; stream only the required bytes instead of `readlines()`.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff (DoS protection).\n\n### 4. Hard-coded Relative Log Paths\n**Insight:** Log location falls back to `.logs/*.jsonl` relative to CWD (lines 68-69).  \n**Evidence:** `Path(\".logs/…\")` resolves to whatever directory the server was started in—often not the project root under systemd, Docker, or IDE runners.  \n**Impact:** Health checks return empty tails in production containers, leading to false assumptions about system activity.  \n**Recommendation:** Resolve paths against a configurable `LOG_DIR` env var with an absolute default (`/var/log/ex-ai-mcp/`).  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff (portability & prod hygiene).\n\n### 5. No Caching or Staleness Checks\n**Insight:** Every call re-enumerates providers and re-reads logs.  \n**Evidence:** `ModelProviderRegistry.get_available_*` and `_tail_file()` invoked on each request (lines 64-72).  \n**Impact:** Registry may hit cloud APIs or disk repeatedly, amplifying latency and rate-limit usage; large JSONL tails re-read each time.  \n**Recommendation:** Cache provider list for 30 s; use inotify/watchdog or simple TTL cache for log tails.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, Medium payoff (scales with probe frequency).\n\n### 6. UX Complexity: Raw JSONL to End-Users\n**Insight:** Tool returns raw log lines as a list of strings (line 77-78).  \n**Evidence:** Consumers (humans or LLMs) must parse JSONL themselves and correlate timestamps.  \n**Impact:** Chat interfaces become noisy; operators need extra tooling to make sense of health output.  \n**Recommendation:** Offer optional `format=\"summary\"` that returns counts (error/warn/info) and last timestamp instead of full lines.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff (usability).\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Add `max_tail=500` clamp in `get_input_schema()` and enforce it in `run()`.  \n- Replace `open()` with `aio",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe HealthTool implementation provides a focused, lightweight mechanism for MCP server health monitoring with clear separation of concerns. While it effectively delivers core functionality (provider status, model availability, log tails), it exhibits critical risks around log handling efficiency, security exposure, and operational resilience. The tool's simplicity is a strength, but its current design may not scale gracefully or meet security requirements in production environments.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Inefficient Log File Handling\n**Insight:** The `_tail_file` method loads entire log files into memory, creating performance and stability risks for large logs.\n**Evidence:**  \n```python\n# LINE 55-57\nwith path.open(\"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\", errors=\"ignore\") as f:\n    lines = f.readlines()  # Reads entire file\n    return [ln.rstrip(\"\\n\") for ln in lines[-n:]]\n```\n**Impact:** Memory consumption scales with log file size, risking OOM errors for large logs. Response times degrade as logs grow, violating the \"compact output\" design goal.\n**Recommendation:** Implement reverse-reading using `seek()` or a streaming approach to read only the last `n` lines without full file loading.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (prevents scaling bottlenecks).\n\n### 2. Unfiltered Log Data Exposure\n**Insight:** Raw log tails are returned without sanitization, creating a security and compliance risk.\n**Evidence:**  \n```python\n# LINE 77-78\n\"metrics_tail\": metrics_tail,  # Raw log lines\n\"toolcalls_tail\": toolcalls_tail,\n```\n**Impact:** Potential exposure of sensitive data (PII, API keys, internal system details) in logs. Violates least-privilege principles for health monitoring.\n**Recommendation:** Add log sanitization pipeline to redact sensitive patterns (e.g., regex for keys/IDs) or truncate log entries to metadata-only.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (critical for compliance).\n\n### 3. Fragile Exception Handling\n**Insight:** Broad exception suppression masks underlying issues and reduces operational visibility.\n**Evidence:**  \n```python\n# LINE 58\nexcept Exception:  # Catches ALL exceptions\n    return []\n```\n**Impact:** Silent failures hide critical issues like permission errors, disk full, or corruption. Compromises reliability of health reporting.\n**Recommendation:** Replace with specific exception handling (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError) and add error logging with context.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (improves debuggability).\n\n### 4. Missing Health Validation Logic\n**Insight:** Tool reports \"configured\" providers but doesn't verify actual reachability or health.\n**Evidence:**  \n```python\n# LINE 64-65\nproviders_with_keys = ModelProviderRegistry.get_available_providers_with_keys()\nmodel_names = ModelProviderRegistry.get_available_model_names()\n```\n**Impact:** False positives - shows providers as \"healthy\" even if APIs are unreachable. Reduces trust in health status.\n**Recommendation:** Add lightweight connectivity checks (e.g., HTTP ping) for each provider during health checks.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (improves accuracy).\n\n### 5. Environment Dependency Risks\n**Insight:** Log paths rely on environment variables with unsafe defaults.\n**Evidence:**  \n```python\n# LINE 68-69\nmetrics_path = Path(os.getenv(\"EX_METRICS_LOG_PATH\", \".logs/metrics.jsonl\"))\ntoolcalls_path = Path(os.getenv(\"EX_TOOLCALL_LOG_PATH\", \".logs/toolcalls.jsonl\"))\n```\n**Impact:** Default relative paths (`.logs/`) may not exist or be writable, causing silent failures. No validation of path accessibility.\n**Recommendation:** Add path existence/writability checks and fail explicitly with clear error messages.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (improves robustness).\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Add file size checks in `_tail_file` to skip processing files >10MB with warning\n- Implement structured error responses with error codes instead of raw exception strings\n- Add log path validation at startup with explicit failure modes\n- Include timestamp of last log entry to detect stale logs\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1:** Implement efficient log tailing and basic sanitization  \n2. **Phase 2:** Add provider connectivity checks and health status scoring  \n3. **Phase 3:** Integrate with observability platform (Prometheus/Grafana) for historical tracking  \n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate:** Refactor `_tail_file` to use reverse-reading (seek-based approach)  \n2. **Short-term:** Implement log sanitization pipeline with configurable redaction rules  \n3. **Medium-term:** Add provider health checks and status aggregation logic  \n\nThe tool demonstrates solid architectural foundations but requires targeted enhancements to meet production-grade reliability and security standards. Prioritize log handling and security improvements before scaling usage.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe `kimi_chat_with_tools` tool is a thin orchestrator that forwards chat requests to the Kimi provider.  \nIt is **functionally adequate** for single-turn prompts, but the implementation is **riddled with defensive patches, hidden defaults, and ad-hoc normalisations** that make behaviour unpredictable for callers and expensive to evolve.  \nNo systemic safeguards exist for back-pressure, token-cost, or prompt-injection, so the component is **not production-ready** under load or in multi-tenant scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Ambient Configuration Soup\n**Insight:** Eight separate environment variables silently override the caller’s intent (`KIMI_DEFAULT_MODEL`, `KIMI_ENABLE_INTERNET_SEARCH`, `KIMI_CHAT_STREAM_DEFAULT`, `KIMI_CHAT_RETURN_RAW_ONLY`, …).  \n**Evidence:** Lines 28, 98-100, 146, 210, 117.  \n**Impact:** Identical payloads can produce wildly different results across deployments → CI flakes, hard-to-reproduce bugs, security surprises (e.g., web-search suddenly enabled in prod).  \n**Recommendation:** Freeze env-driven overrides; expose an optional `runtime_options` object in the schema so callers opt-in explicitly.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High.\n\n### 2. Hidden Web-Search Injection\n**Insight:** A boolean flag (`use_websearch`) triggers automatic append of `$web_search` tool without surfacing it in the returned payload.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 103-117.  \n**Impact:** Callers cannot audit or cache the final tool list; breaks deterministic LLM evaluations and violates least-surprise.  \n**Recommendation:** Return the *effective* tool list in the response metadata; log injection at INFO level.\n\n### 3. Ad-Hoc Message Normalisation\n**Insight:** Five different coercions (string → user message, dict missing `content` → empty string, non-dict item → `str(item)`, etc.) are applied inside the critical path.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 121-143.  \n**Impact:** Silent data loss (e.g., `{\"role\":\"system\"}` with no `content` becomes `{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"\"}`) → behaviour drift, harder prompt debugging.  \n**Recommendation:** Reject malformed messages with 4xx instead of silently fixing; provide a `/validate` helper endpoint for pre-flight checks.\n\n### 4. No Back-Pressure or Cost Guardrails\n**Insight:** Tool can be invoked with arbitrary message history and `stream=true`; no max-tokens, request-timeout, or spend-limit is enforced.  \n**Evidence:** Entire `execute` method.  \n**Impact:** Single rogue caller can exhaust Kimi quota or fill logs with multi-MB streaming chunks.  \n**Recommendation:** Wrap the provider call with a circuit-breaker (timeout, retry, token-budget) and surface `429`/`504` to the MCP client.\n\n### 5. Thread-Pool Streaming Anti-Pattern\n**Insight:** Streaming is materialised fully in a background thread (`_aio.to_thread`) then re-serialised as one JSON blob, defeating the purpose of streaming.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 149-188.  \n**Impact:** Memory spike proportional to response size; clients still wait until EOS before seeing first byte.  \n**Recommendation:** Either return an MCP `StreamableHttpContent` (if MCP spec supports it) or disable streaming until native async iterators are plumbed through the transport.\n\n### 6. Implicit Provider Fallback\n**Insight:** If the registry lookup fails, a new `KimiModelProvider` is constructed on-the-fly using `KIMI_API_KEY`.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 69-74.  \n**Impact:** Side-steps dependency-injection configuration; API key may be stale or mis-scoped, causing cryptic 401s deep inside the call.  \n**Recommendation:** Make provider resolution strict; fail fast with “model not registered” instead of fallback.\n\n### 7. Brittle Tool & Tool-Choice Parsing\n**Insight:** JSON string tools are swallowed on parse error; non-standard `tool_choice` strings are nulled.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 80-95.  \n**Impact:** Caller believes tools were supplied but they silently disappear → perplexing 400 from Kimi or no tool calls.  \n**Recommendation:** Validate early, return structured error pointing to the offending field.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Add `max_tokens`, `timeout`, `n` (num_choices) to input schema with sane caps.  \n- Log the *effective* request payload (sans key) at DEBUG.  \n- Replace `pydantic_encoder` + `json.loads` round-trip with `completion.model_dump_json()` (one pass, faster).  \n- Freeze env var list in code comments; fail on unknown keys to avoid typos.\n\n---\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe `kimi_chat_with_tools` tool demonstrates solid architectural alignment with MCP standards and provides robust Kimi model integration with flexible tool usage. However, it suffers from significant maintainability risks due to monolithic execution logic, environment variable over-reliance, and complex input normalization. While the streaming implementation and fallback mechanisms show good resilience, the current structure impedes scalability and future extensibility without refactoring.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Monolithic Execution Method\n**Insight:** The `execute` method (lines 67-236) violates single responsibility by handling provider resolution, input normalization, tool injection, streaming, and response formatting in one 170-line block.\n**Evidence:** Method spans 170 lines with distinct logical sections (provider setup at lines 68-74, tool normalization at 76-96, message parsing at 119-143, streaming at 149-188).\n**Impact:** Creates high cognitive load for maintenance, increases regression risk during changes, and hinders unit testing of individual components.\n**Recommendation:** Decompose into focused private methods: `_resolve_provider()`, `_normalize_tools()`, `_parse_messages()`, `_handle_streaming()`, and `_format_response()`.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff.\n\n### 2. Environment Variable Anti-Pattern\n**Insight:** Heavy reliance on environment variables (8+ unique vars) creates hidden dependencies and configuration fragility.\n**Evidence:** Scattered usage across lines 28 (`KIMI_DEFAULT_MODEL`), 69 (model resolution), 99-101 (`KIMI_ENABLE_INTERNET_TOOL`), 146 (`KIMI_CHAT_STREAM_DEFAULT`), 210 (`KIMI_CHAT_RETURN_RAW_ONLY`).\n**Impact:** Reduces testability (requires env mocking), causes runtime surprises when vars change, and complicates deployment configuration.\n**Recommendation:** Introduce a `KimiConfig` dataclass encapsulating all env-derived defaults with validation, injected during tool initialization.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff.\n\n### 3. Brittle Input Normalization\n**Insight:** Complex message normalization logic (lines 120-143) attempts to handle too many edge cases with nested conditionals.\n**Evidence:** Handles string/list/dict inputs with fallbacks like `content = str(item)` (line 140) and `content = \"\"` (line 136), risking data loss.\n**Impact:** High surface area for subtle bugs when handling unexpected input formats, and difficult to extend for new message types.\n**Recommendation:** Implement a dedicated `MessageNormalizer` class using visitor pattern for type-specific handling, with strict schema validation.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, Medium payoff.\n\n### 4. Streaming Implementation Risk\n**Insight:** Streaming logic (lines 149-188) uses thread-blocking `_aio.to_thread` with nested exception handling that could mask errors.\n**Evidence:** Broad `except Exception` (line 173) ignores malformed chunks, and thread execution (line 180) lacks timeout controls.\n**Impact:** Potential for silent failures, resource leaks, or unbounded blocking under provider API issues.\n**Recommendation:** Add explicit timeout handling, structured error logging, and chunk validation before accumulation.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff.\n\n### 5. Tool Injection Coupling\n**Insight:** Web search tool injection (lines 103-118) hardcodes the `$web_search` structure and assumes OpenAI schema.\n**Evidence:** Direct dict creation (lines 105-110) with `\"type\": \"builtin_function\"` and fixed `\"name\": \"$web_search\"`.\n**Impact:** Breaks if Kimi changes tool format, and prevents supporting other built-in tools without code changes.\n**Recommendation:** Abstract tool injection via a provider interface method (e.g., `prov.get_builtin_tools()`) with configuration-driven selection.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff.\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Add timeout parameter to `_aio.to_thread` calls (line 180) to prevent indefinite blocking\n- Replace broad `except Exception` (line 173) with specific error types and logging\n- Extract hardcoded web search tool dict (lines 105-110) into a constant\n- Add input validation for `temperature` (line 160) to prevent provider API errors\n- Implement basic request/response logging at method entry/exit points\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1**: Refactor `execute()` into modular methods and introduce configuration class\n2. **Phase 2**: Implement provider-agnostic tool injection and message normalization\n3. **Phase 3**: Add request caching and rate limiting for scalability\n4. **Phase 4**: Introduce observability hooks (metrics/tracing) for operational monitoring\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Prioritize execute() refactoring**: Break down the monolithic method into focused components to immediately improve maintainability\n2. **Implement configuration class**: Consolidate environment variable handling into a validated configuration object\n3. **Add error resilience**: Enhance streaming error handling and input validation to reduce runtime instability risks\n\nThese changes will transform the tool from a functional but fragile implementation into a maintainable, extensible component aligned with long-term architectural goals while preserving its current feature capabilities.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe `kimi_upload_and_extract` tool is a single-purpose bridge between local files and Moonshot’s Kimi Files API.  \nIt is built on a clean, pluggable MCP tool base, adds local SHA-based caching to avoid re-uploads, and surfaces extracted text as system messages.  \nHowever, the implementation mixes I/O, retry, caching, and observability concerns inside one 170-line method, relies on hard-coded env-vars for tuning, and exposes no back-pressure or progress feedback to callers. These factors make the component brittle under concurrent load, hard to test, and risky for large-file or high-throughput scenarios.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Monolithic _run Method\n**Insight:** All side-effects (file I/O, upload, retry-loop, cache write, metrics emission) live in one synchronous function.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 66-171—no helper smaller than 20 LOC.  \n**Impact:** Unit tests must mock the provider, cache, observability and filesystem; changes in any layer trigger re-testing everything.  \n**Recommendation:** Split into `hash_and_cache()`, `upload_if_missing()`, `fetch_with_retry()`, `emit_metrics()`; keep `_run()` as orchestrator only.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High\n\n### 2. Hidden, Untuned Retry Policy\n**Insight:** Retry count/backoff is read from env-vars with fall-backs, but no jitter, exponential cap, or logging.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 135-153; sleeps block thread pool (via `asyncio.to_thread`).  \n**Impact:** Thundering-retry bursts when many files fail (e.g., 429) can worsen provider load and lengthen tail latency.  \n**Recommendation:** Replace inline loop with `tenacity` or equivalent—add jitter, max-time budget, structured logs.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 3. Cache Key Collision & Eviction Gap\n**Insight:** Cache key is SHA-256 only; no inclusion of `purpose`, model version, or upload options.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 95, 121.  \n**Impact:** Same file uploaded with different `purpose` re-uses cached ID, potentially returning wrong parsed text.  \n**Recommendation:** Extend cache key: `sha256[:16]:purpose`; add TTL or size-based eviction policy.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High\n\n### 4. Lack of Streaming / Progress Feedback\n**Insight:** Tool is async but still materialises full file text in memory and returns a single JSON blob.  \n**Evidence:** Line 177 dumps entire `msgs` array.  \n**Impact:** UX freezes for >50 MB files; memory spikes can crash the MCP server.  \n**Recommendation:** Offer optional `\"stream\": true` parameter yielding `TextContent` per file; or paginate returned messages.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High\n\n### 5. Implicit Thread-Pool Blocking\n**Insight:** `asyncio.to_thread` is used, yet retry sleeps and SHA-256 hashing run on that thread.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 176, 147.  \n**Impact:** Under concurrent calls the default thread pool (≈8 threads) saturates, blocking the event loop.  \n**Recommendation:** Use `aiofiles` for hashing, and `anyio` task-group with semaphore for concurrency cap.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / Medium\n\n### 6. Over-Privileged Error Swallowing\n**Insight:** All observability and cache writes are wrapped in bare `except Exception: pass`.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 103, 110, 124, 130, 162, 168.  \n**Impact:** Silent failures mask corruption or quota issues; hard to debug in production.  \n**Recommendation:** Log at debug level even when continuing; escalate on critical failures (e.g., cache write fails repeatedly).  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 7. Security: Unvalidated Path & Size\n**Insight:** File paths are used directly; no check for symlink, traversal, or size until provider rejects.  \n**Evidence:** Line 84 uses `str(fp)` straight from user input.  \n**Impact:** Malicious client can upload `/etc/passwd` or 5 GB video, exhausting quota or leaking data.  \n**Recommendation:** Resolve under project root, reject `..`, enforce `KIMI_FILES_MAX_SIZE_MB` locally before upload.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Replace inline retry loop with `tenacity` (≤30 min).  \n- Add `purpose` to cache key; flush cache script for ops (≤1 h).  \n- Validate & normalise file paths with `Path.resolve()` under repo root (≤30 min).  \n- Surface structured logs for cache hit/miss/upload error (≤1 h).  \n- Document",

While the caching and retry mechanisms show good foresight, the implementation's brittleness and performance bottlenecks pose significant risks for production use.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Async/Sync Architecture Mismatch\n**Insight:** The tool mixes synchronous I/O operations in an async context, creating thread pool exhaustion risks and performance bottlenecks.\n**Evidence:** \n- Line 173: `execute` is async but uses `asyncio.to_thread` (line 176) to run synchronous `_run`\n- Line 66: `_run` performs blocking file I/O (line 95) and network requests (line 141) synchronously\n**Impact:** Under concurrent usage, thread pool saturation will cause severe latency spikes and potential deadlocks. Violates async best practices for I/O-bound operations.\n**Recommendation:** Refactor to fully async pattern using `aiofiles` for file operations and async HTTP client for network calls. Replace `asyncio.to_thread` with native async.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort; High payoff (critical for stability)\n\n### 2. Systematic Error Suppression\n**Insight:** Widespread `try-except Exception: pass` patterns mask critical failures and create silent data corruption risks.\n**Evidence:**\n- Lines 103-104, 110-111, 124-125, 127-131, 148-149, 160-164, 167-170: 7+ locations silently swallow exceptions\n- Line 113: Cache failures set `file_id=None` but continue execution\n**Impact:** Silent failures in caching, observability, and retry logic will cause data loss, incorrect metrics, and undiagnosable production issues. Creates a \"black box\" system.\n**Recommendation:** Replace all `except Exception: pass` with specific exception handling and mandatory logging. Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Critical payoff (prevents data corruption)\n\n### 3. Inefficient Sequential Processing\n**Insight:** Files are processed sequentially instead of concurrently, creating unnecessary latency for batch operations.\n**Evidence:** \n- Line 83: `for idx, fp in enumerate(files)` processes files one-by-one\n- Line 134: `_fetch()` blocks per file with no concurrency\n**Impact:** For N files, processing time is O(N) instead of O(1). Network-bound operations compound delays, making batch uploads impractical.\n**Recommendation:** Implement concurrent processing using `asyncio.gather` with bounded concurrency. Add per-file timeout controls.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (10-100x speed improvement)\n\n### 4. Configuration Fragility\n**Insight:** Heavy reliance on runtime environment variables creates deployment risks and testing challenges.\n**Evidence:**\n- Line 73: `os.getenv(\"KIMI_DEFAULT_MODEL\")`\n- Line 89: `os.getenv(\"FILECACHE_ENABLED\")`\n- Lines 135-137: Retry parameters from environment\n**Impact:** Configuration changes require restarts, environment-specific bugs are likely, and testing requires complex setup. Violates dependency injection principles.\n**Recommendation:** Introduce a configuration class with validation, loaded at startup. Support runtime config updates where safe.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; Medium payoff (improves deployability)\n\n### 5. Cache Implementation Risks\n**Insight:** File caching lacks validation and error handling, creating consistency risks.\n**Evidence:**\n- Line 95: `FileCache.sha256_file(pth)` could fail silently\n- Line 97: `fc.get()` returns cached ID without validation\n- Line 123: Cache set occurs after upload but before validation\n**Impact:** Stale cache entries could persist after failed uploads. SHA256 computation failures cause unnecessary re-uploads. No cache invalidation strategy.\n**Recommendation:** Add cache entry validation against provider API. Implement TTL-based expiration. Cache only after successful content retrieval.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; Medium payoff (prevents cache poisoning)\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Replace all `except Exception: pass` with specific exception logging (lines 103, 110, 124, 127, 148, 160, 167)\n- Move environment variable reads to class initialization (lines 73, 89, 135-137)\n- Add file size validation before upload (line 116) to prevent API limit violations\n- Implement request timeout for `_fetch()` (line 134) to prevent hangs\n- Add structured logging for all cache operations (lines 94-112)\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1:** Stabilization - Fix error handling and add comprehensive logging\n2. **Phase 2:** Performance - Implement async/await pattern and concurrent file processing\n3. **Phase 3:** Architecture - Introduce dependency injection for configuration and providers\n4. **Phase 4:** Resilience - Add circuit breakers, proper cache invalidation, and retry policies\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate:** Audit and eliminate all silent exception handling - this is the highest risk item\n2. **Short-term:** Implement async/await refactoring for file operations and network calls\n3. **Medium-term:** Add integration tests covering failure scenarios (network errors, cache failures, large files)\n\nThe tool shows good architectural intent but requires immediate attention to error handling and async patterns before production deployment. The sequential processing and configuration fragility should be addressed in the next development cycle.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe `listmodels` tool is a read-only utility that surfaces runtime model availability across four provider categories (Kimi, GLM, OpenRouter, Custom). It is architecturally sound for its narrow purpose, but the implementation couples presentation logic to provider internals, performs redundant I/O and registry walks, and hard-codes provider metadata. These choices create a brittle surface that will drift as new providers or model metadata are added, and they expose the CLI to latency spikes when OpenRouter’s endpoint is slow or large.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Tight Coupling Between Presentation and Provider Internals\n**Insight:** The tool directly imports provider-specific classes (`ProviderType`, `ModelProviderRegistry`, `OpenRouterModelRegistry`) and reaches into their private data structures (`get_model_configurations()`, `list_models()`, `resolve()`).  \n**Evidence:** Lines 87-89, 169-173, 241-246.  \n**Impact:** Any rename or signature change in the provider layer breaks this tool; new providers require code changes here rather than pure configuration.  \n**Recommendation:** Introduce a thin, stable “ModelCatalog” port (interface) that every provider implements. `listmodels` should depend only on that port; adapters convert provider internals to the catalog DTO.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High\n\n### 2. Redundant & Unbounded Registry Traversal\n**Insight:** The code walks the entire OpenRouter registry twice (once via `provider.list_models`, once via `registry.list_aliases`) and materialises every model name into memory. With OpenRouter’s ~400+ models this is harmless today, but growth or a slow network call blocks the CLI.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 172, 177-191, 244-247.  \n**Impact:** Latency variability; memory footprint grows with catalog size; impossible to paginate or filter later.  \n**Recommendation:** Stream models through a generator and apply server-side filtering (already supported by `respect_restrictions=True`) instead of client-side grouping.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 3. Hard-Coded Provider Metadata Map\n**Insight:** `provider_info` (lines 94-97) is a static dict keyed by enum values. Adding a fifth provider means editing this file, violating OCP.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 94-97, 105, 150.  \n**Impact:** Onboarding new providers requires touching utility code, increasing review surface and merge conflicts.  \n**Recommendation:** Move friendly name and env-key into each provider’s registration record; let the catalog port (see #1) expose them.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High\n\n### 4. Mixed Formatting & Localisation Concerns Inside Core Logic\n**Insight:** Markdown formatting, emoji choice, and human-readable context strings (lines 118-123, 128-137) are embedded in the executor.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 91-302.  \n**Impact:** UI changes require redeploying core logic; impossible to reuse the same data for JSON/API consumers.  \n**Recommendation:** Separate “data” and “view” layers: return a structured DTO (provider→models→meta) and plug in formatters (Markdown, JSON, HTML).  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / Medium\n\n### 5. Hidden Failure Modes for Partial Outages\n**Insight:** Any exception during OpenRouter or Custom model enumeration is caught, logged, and surfaced as a one-line string (lines 222-223, 257-258). Users cannot distinguish “no models” from “service down”.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 222, 257.  \n**Impact:** Silent degradation; support tickets when models disappear.  \n**Recommendation:** Return a structured error flag (`partial_failure=True`) and let the formatter display a warning box; emit metrics for observability.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Cache the result of `OpenRouterModelRegistry().list_aliases()` for the lifetime of the CLI command (seconds) to avoid double walks.  \n- Replace magic strings (`\"Ultra-fast\"`, `\"EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE\"`) with an enum or capability tags supplied by the provider.  \n- Add a `--format=json` flag tomorrow by extracting the data structure before line 302; zero breaking change.  \n- Log the elapsed time for provider calls to spot latency regressions early.\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. Publish a stable “ModelCatalog” service interface; make `listmodels` the first consumer, then migrate chat/completion tools to reuse it.  \n2. Introduce server-side streaming pagination so the CLI can display models incrementally when catalogs exceed terminal height.  \n3. Add telemetry events (`model.list.shown`, `model.list.error`) to drive usage analytics and provider health dashboards.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Refactor to a ModelCatalog",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe `listmodels` tool implementation provides a comprehensive model inventory across multiple providers but exhibits critical scalability limitations through hardcoded provider configurations and repetitive code patterns. While operationally stable for current use cases, its architecture creates maintenance overhead and UX complexity risks as the provider ecosystem grows. The tool effectively fulfills its core purpose but requires strategic refactoring to support long-term extensibility.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Hardcoded Provider Configuration Bottleneck\n**Insight:** Provider definitions are statically coded, creating a maintenance burden and limiting extensibility.\n**Evidence:** Lines 94-97 hardcode only two native providers (KIMI/GLM) with manual environment key mapping. Adding new providers requires code changes in this tool.\n```python\nprovider_info = {\n    ProviderType.KIMI: {\"name\": \"Moonshot Kimi\", \"env_key\": \"KIMI_API_KEY\"},\n    ProviderType.GLM: {\"name\": \"ZhipuAI GLM\", \"env_key\": \"GLM_API_KEY\"},\n}\n```\n**Impact:** Violates open/closed principle, increases deployment friction, and creates inconsistency risks when new providers are added to the system but not reflected here.\n**Recommendation:** Refactor to use dynamic provider discovery via `ModelProviderRegistry.get_all_providers()` and extract metadata (name, env key) from provider implementations rather than hardcoded mappings.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff.\n\n### 2. Repetitive Code Structure and Inconsistent Abstraction\n**Insight:** Three nearly identical provider-handling blocks (native/OpenRouter/custom) violate DRY principles with duplicated logic.\n**Evidence:** Separate code blocks for native providers (lines 100-152), OpenRouter (154-226), and custom (230-262) repeat configuration checks, error handling, and output formatting patterns.\n```python\n# Pattern repeats for each provider type:\nif is_configured:\n    output_lines.append(\"**Status**: Configured and available\")\n    # ... model listing logic ...\nelse:\n    output_lines.append(f\"**Status**: Not configured (set {env_key})\")\n```\n**Impact:** Triples maintenance effort, increases bug surface area, and creates inconsistent UX (e.g., OpenRouter shows model groupings while others don't).\n**Recommendation:** Extract common provider-handling logic into a helper method accepting provider type, configuration status, and model listing function.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff.\n\n### 3. Performance and Output Scalability Risks\n**Insight:** Unbounded model listing could cause performance degradation and UX issues with large provider ecosystems.\n**Evidence:** No pagination or result limits; OpenRouter section loads ALL models (line 177) without truncation. Context window formatting logic (lines 118-123) processes every model individually.\n```python\nfor model_name in available_models:  # Show ALL available models\n    # ... processing per model ...\n```\n**Impact:** Potential slow execution with 1000+ models, memory overhead, and overwhelming user output. No mechanism to handle \"model explosion\" from providers like OpenRouter.\n**Recommendation:** Implement pagination (e.g., `--limit` parameter) and lazy loading for model details. Add performance monitoring for model listing operations.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff.\n\n### 4. Fragile Dependency Coupling\n**Insight:** Late imports and tight coupling to implementation details create instability risks.\n**Evidence:** Critical imports inside `execute()` (lines 87-89, 166-167, 285-286) rather than module level. Direct dependency on `OpenRouterModelRegistry` for custom models (line 241) despite different provider types.\n```python\nfrom src.providers.openrouter_registry import OpenRouterModelRegistry  # Inside execute()\n```\n**Impact:** Runtime import failures if dependencies change, and architectural confusion (custom models shouldn't depend on OpenRouter-specific classes).\n**Recommendation:** Move imports to module level with proper exception handling. Abstract model registry access through interfaces rather than concrete classes.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff.\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Replace magic strings like `\"your_openrouter_api_key_here\"` (line 156) with environment constants\n- Add timeout handling for external API calls in OpenRouter section\n- Extract context window formatting (lines 118-123) into a utility function\n- Standardize error messages across provider blocks for consistent UX\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1 - Dynamic Provider Discovery**: Refactor provider handling to use registry-driven metadata instead of hardcoded mappings\n2. **Phase 2 - Unified Output Abstraction**: Create a `ProviderDisplayAdapter` interface to normalize model information display\n3. **Phase 3 - Performance Optimization**: Implement streaming output and caching for large model inventories\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate**: Extract provider-handling logic into reusable helper methods to eliminate code duplication\n2. **Short-term**: Implement dynamic provider discovery by extending `ModelProviderRegistry` with metadata capabilities\n3. **Medium-term**: Add pagination and performance monitoring to handle growing model ecosystems\n\nThe tool's core functionality is sound, but its current architecture impedes scalability. Addressing the hardcoded configuration bottleneck and repetitive code patterns will yield the highest ROI for long-term maintainability.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview  \nThe planner is a conversational, step-wise planning micro-service that piggy-backs on a generic “workflow tool” framework. It is stateless from the MCP-server’s point of view (all state lives in the orchestrator’s conversation memory) and therefore scales horizontally, but the implementation is already showing three systemic pressure points:  \n1. Over-grown inheritance stack (≈ 550 lines, 30+ override hooks) that makes behaviour discovery hard.  \n2. All plan history, branches and revisions are kept only in the orchestrator’s message array; nothing is persisted or version-controlled – a reliability & audit liability.  \n3. UX complexity: 11 optional flags, deep-thinking pauses and branch bookkeeping create a heavy cognitive load for casual users while offering no programmatic API for power users.\n\nOverall the module works for its current scope, yet the architecture is drifting toward “framework for the sake of framework” and will slow future iteration once plan templates, collaboration or persistence are requested.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Framework Over-Engineering & Inheritance Explosion  \n**Insight:** 18 abstract methods from `WorkflowTool` are overridden, 10 more hooks added; half of the code is meta-programming, not planning logic.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 256-529 are almost pure glue; e.g. `get_skip_expert_analysis_status()` returns a constant string.  \n**Impact:** New team members need >30 min to trace a single user story; refactors touch many unrelated override points → regression risk.  \n**Recommendation:** Collapse planner-specific behaviour into a single 150-line “PlanningEngine” class; inherit only `execute_workflow()` and delegate to the engine.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High\n\n### 2. Implicit State in Chat Memory – No Persistence or Concurrency Control  \n**Insight:** `self.branches` and `self.work_history` live inside the tool instance that is re-created per request; the real store is the LLM orchestrator’s message array.  \n**Evidence:** `self.branches` (l.129) is populated but never serialised; on server restart or horizontal scale-out all branches vanish.  \n**Impact:** Users cannot return to an earlier plan after session drop; no audit trail; impossible to share or version plans.  \n**Recommendation:** Introduce a light “PlanSession” repository (file, SQLite or Redis) keyed by `continuation_id`; persist branches & revisions as JSON blobs; keep chat memory as cache only.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High\n\n### 3. UX Complexity & Parameter Proliferation  \n**Insight:** 11 optional boolean/integer fields plus free-text `step` make the JSON interface error-prone; deep-thinking pauses add friction for short plans.  \n**Evidence:** Schema builder (l.186-250) lists 8 planner-specific fields; prompt text (l.384-422) forces multi-minute pauses even for 5-step plans.  \n**Impact:** Onboarding docs grow, first-time failure rate increases, prompt engineering effort balloons.  \n**Recommendation:**  \n- Hide branching flags behind an “advanced” flag; default path accepts only `step`, `step_number`, `total_steps`.  \n- Make deep-thinking pause threshold configurable (default ≥8 steps) or opt-in.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 4. Hidden Coupling to Orchestrator Prompt Templates  \n**Insight:** `PLANNER_PROMPT` (l.32) is imported but not version-locked; orchestrator can change prompt semantics without code review in this repo.  \n**Evidence:** Prompt lives outside the module; no checksum or interface test asserts expected behaviour.  \n**Impact:** Silent regressions when prompt is tuned; planner may start emitting markdown tables while UI expects plain list.  \n**Recommendation:** Store a frozen copy of the prompt in `planner.py` plus a unit test that hashes expected prompt; upgrade explicitly.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High\n\n### 5. Missing Validation for Branch Integrity  \n**Insight:** A branch can claim `branch_from_step: 999` even if only 3 steps exist; revisions can target future steps.  \n**Evidence:** No cross-step validation in `PlannerRequest` or `customize_workflow_response`.  \n**Impact:** Corrupted plan trees, confusing UI rendering, possible infinite loops if client auto-increments step numbers.  \n**Recommendation:** Add a post-condition check in `prepare_step_data()` that `revises_step_number <= current_step_count` and `branch_from_step <= current_step_count`.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n---\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Replace 30-line status-mapping block (l.490-500) with a 3-entry dict literal.  \n- Add `max_length=100` validator to `branch_id` to prevent huge metadata blobs.  \n- Log a warning",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe planner tool demonstrates a well-structured architecture for sequential planning with sophisticated features like branching, revision, and deep thinking pauses. While it effectively addresses complex planning scenarios through its workflow-based design, it exhibits significant architectural complexity in schema management and tight coupling to the base workflow framework. The tool's self-contained nature enhances stability, but its extensive field exclusions and metadata handling create maintainability risks that could impede future evolution.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Schema Management Overengineering\n**Insight:** The input schema implementation suffers from excessive complexity due to extensive field exclusions and overrides, creating a maintenance burden.\n**Evidence:** Lines 181-250 show 15 excluded fields across two categories (`excluded_workflow_fields` and `excluded_common_fields`) plus 6 planner-specific overrides. The `WorkflowSchemaBuilder.build_schema()` call requires manual exclusion lists that must be maintained in sync with base class changes.\n**Impact:** High maintenance cost and fragility - any base workflow schema change risks breaking the planner's input validation. This violates the DRY principle and increases regression testing scope.\n**Recommendation:** Refactor to use composition over inheritance for schema building. Create a dedicated `PlannerSchemaBuilder` that inherits core functionality but explicitly defines only relevant fields, eliminating exclusion lists.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff (reduces maintenance burden by ~70%).\n\n### 2. State Management Brittleness\n**Insight:** In-memory state management without persistence creates session fragility and limits scalability.\n**Evidence:** Branch state is stored in `self.branches = {}` (line 129) without serialization. Work history relies entirely on `self.work_history` from the base class with no backup mechanism.\n**Impact:** Planning sessions are lost on server restart, preventing recovery of complex multi-step plans. This creates operational risk for long-running planning tasks and limits horizontal scaling.\n**Recommendation:** Implement a pluggable persistence layer (e.g., SQLite or Redis) with automatic checkpointing after each planning step. Add session resumption capability via continuation IDs.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff (enables session recovery and horizontal scaling).\n\n### 3. Metadata Duplication Inconsistency\n**Insight:** Critical metadata is constructed in multiple locations with overlapping but not identical logic, creating inconsistency risks.\n**Evidence:** Metadata is built separately in `build_base_response()` (lines 356-364) and `customize_workflow_response()` (lines 451-462). The `step_history_length` appears in both with identical calculation but separate implementations.\n**Impact:** High risk of metadata divergence during maintenance, potentially causing incorrect step tracking or branch state corruption. Violates single-source-of-truth principle.\n**Recommendation:** Extract metadata construction into a dedicated `_build_planner_metadata()` helper method called by both response builders. Implement unit tests verifying metadata consistency.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff (eliminates duplication and consistency bugs).\n\n### 4. Deep Thinking Pause UX Complexity\n**Insight:** Mandatory deep thinking pauses, while valuable for complex plans, create cognitive friction and workflow interruption risks.\n**Evidence:** Lines 384-422 implement forced pauses with strict instructions like \"MANDATORY: DO NOT call the planner tool again immediately\" (line 391). The pauses trigger for any plan ≥5 steps regardless of actual complexity.\n**Impact:** Potential user frustration from artificial workflow interruptions, especially for moderately complex plans. May reduce adoption for time-sensitive planning scenarios.\n**Recommendation:** Make deep thinking pauses configurable with complexity thresholds. Add a \"quick planning\" mode that skips pauses for users who prefer continuous flow. Include visual progress indicators during pauses.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff (improves UX flexibility).\n\n### 5. Validation Logic Gaps\n**Insight:** Field validation is incomplete for critical planning state transitions, risking inconsistent plan evolution.\n**Evidence:** Validators exist for `step_number` and `total_steps` (lines 98-110) but not for branching/revision fields. No validation ensures `revises_step_number` < current step or that `branch_from_step` references existing steps.\n**Impact:** Potential for corrupted plan states with invalid revisions or orphaned branches. Could cause planning session failures with confusing error messages.\n**Recommendation:** Add Pydantic validators for all planning state transitions. Implement a `validate_plan_state()` method that checks branching/revision consistency before processing steps.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff (prevents state corruption bugs).\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Consolidate metadata construction into a single helper method (lines 356-364 and 451-462)\n- Add missing validators for branching/revision fields (lines 70-75)\n- Implement basic logging for branch operations to aid debugging\n- Add unit tests for schema exclusion lists to catch base class changes early\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1 (0-3 months):** Address immediate technical debt - metadata consolidation, validation gaps, and logging improvements\n2. **Phase 2 (3-6 months):** Implement persistence layer and session recovery capabilities\n3. **Phase 3 (6-12 months):** Architectural refactoring - replace inheritance-based schema building with composition\n4. **Phase 4 (12+ months):** Enhanced UX features - configurable deep thinking, visual planning timeline, collaborative planning support\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate:** Consolidate metadata construction logic and add missing field validators to improve stability\n2. **Short-term:** Implement basic persistence using SQLite for session recovery and operational resilience\n3. **Medium-term:** Initiate architectural refactoring to decouple schema management from base workflow framework\n4. **Validation:** Create comprehensive test suite covering all branching/revision scenarios and schema edge cases\n\nThe planner tool shows strong architectural intent but requires focused refactoring to reduce complexity and improve maintainability. Prioritizing schema management and state persistence will provide the highest ROI for long-term stability and scalability.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview  \nThe pre-commit tool is a well-intentioned attempt to wrap systematic, multi-step validation behind a single CLI façade.  \nStrengths: clear separation of concerns (schema, workflow, expert fallback) and extensive field-level documentation.  \nRisks: the implementation is **over-orchestrated**—it couples UI guidance, state management, and business logic in one 700-line class, relies on brittle string-based confidence levels, and forces a rigid step-wise protocol that will **frustrate CI/automation** and **slow interactive use**.  \nMaintainability and future extensibility are already strained: any change to validation rules or UX copy requires editing the monolithic tool, and the lack of tests or telemetry means regressions will be silent.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Monolithic God-Class Architecture\n**Insight:** `PrecommitTool` mixes schema generation, workflow orchestration, prompt templating, expert-analysis dispatch, and UI messaging in a single 700-line unit.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 183–705 contain ~20 responsibilities (e.g., `get_required_actions`, `prepare_expert_analysis_context`, `customize_workflow_response`).  \n**Impact:** High coupling → every feature change ripples through the class; onboarding new contributors requires understanding the entire file; impossible to unit-test in isolation.  \n**Recommendation:** Split into four collaborating components:  \n- `PrecommitOrchestrator` – pure workflow state machine  \n- `PrecommitValidator` – pluggable validation rules (security, perf, style)  \n- `PrecommitPresenter` – CLI/JSON output formatting  \n- `ExpertAnalysisService` – optional LLM fallback  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (sustained velocity, testability).\n\n### 2. String-Based Confidence & Control Flow\n**Insight:** Confidence is modeled as seven magic strings (`exploring` → `certain`) used both for UI guidance and **skip-expert-analysis logic** (`request.confidence == \"certain\"`).  \n**Evidence:** Lines 96–100, 504.  \n**Impact:** Typo-prone, non-extensible, and impossible to introspect programmatically; a single mis-cased string bypasses expert review silently.  \n**Recommendation:** Replace with `IntEnum` (`ConfidenceLevel.EXPLORING … CERTAIN`) and expose explicit policy flags (`skip_expert: bool = Field(default=False)`).  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (eliminates whole class of silent bugs).\n\n### 3. Rigid Step-wise Protocol Blocks Automation\n**Insight:** The tool **mandates** human-driven pause-investigate-resume cycles (`get_required_actions` returns prose instructions that must be obeyed).  \n**Evidence:** Lines 612–647 emit “MANDATORY: DO NOT call … again immediately.”  \n**Impact:** Cannot be dropped into CI pipelines or IDE save-hooks; defeats the very purpose of a *pre-commit* gate.  \n**Recommendation:** Provide an `auto` mode that internally executes the same investigations (git diff, file reads, rule checks) without CLI agent involvement; keep interactive mode opt-in.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (tool becomes universally usable).\n\n### 4. Over-Specified Pydantic Schema Duplication\n**Insight:** Field descriptions are copy-pasted into a 120-line dict (`PRECOMMIT_WORKFLOW_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS`) and then re-declared as Pydantic fields—violating DRY and ballooning the file.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 35–122 vs. 129–168.  \n**Impact:** Drift between description dict and actual field defaults; harder to keep docs in sync.  \n**Recommendation:** Use `Field(description=...)` directly and generate help text from the model’s `schema_json()`; drop the redundant dict.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Low-Medium payoff (permanent reduction in boilerplate).\n\n### 5. Hidden Global State & Race Conditions\n**Insight:** `self.initial_request` and `self.git_config` are mutated during step handling but the class is registered as a **singleton** tool; concurrent pre-commit runs (e.g., two repos) will overwrite each other’s state.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 195–196, 656–666.  \n**Impact:** Non-deterministic context passed to expert analysis; possible leakage of sensitive repo paths.  \n**Recommendation:** Move per-invocation state into a dataclass stored in a `contextvar` or returned explicitly—make the tool stateless.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (enables safe parallel usage).\n\n### 6. No Observability or Metrics\n**Insight:** Tool logs at `INFO` level only; no timing, success-rate, or issue-severity metrics.  \n**Impact:** Impossible to detect which validation rules are noisy or slow; regress",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe precommit tool demonstrates a sophisticated workflow architecture for systematic pre-commit validation, offering comprehensive change analysis and expert integration. However, its excessive complexity, state management risks, and overengineered schema generation create significant maintainability burdens. While the tool excels in providing structured validation guidance, its current implementation poses scalability challenges and introduces unnecessary UX friction that could hinder adoption in fast-paced development environments.\n\n## Strategic Findings\n\n### 1. Overengineered Schema Generation\n**Insight:** Manual JSON schema construction creates maintenance overhead and inconsistency risks.\n**Evidence:** The `get_input_schema` method (lines 243-338) manually defines a 100+ line schema with hardcoded field descriptions, duplicating Pydantic model metadata. For example:\n```python\n\"step\": {\n    \"type\": \"string\",\n    \"description\": PRECOMMIT_WORKFLOW_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS[\"step\"],\n},\n```\n**Impact:** Schema changes require dual updates (Pydantic model + manual schema), increasing bug risk. This violates DRY principles and makes evolution cumbersome.\n**Recommendation:** Replace manual schema generation with Pydantic's built-in `model_json_schema()` using field overrides only where necessary.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High benefit.\n\n### 2. Excessive State Management Complexity\n**Insight:** Uncontrolled state variables create thread-safety risks and cognitive overhead.\n**Evidence:** The tool maintains multiple stateful properties without clear lifecycle management:\n```python\nself.initial_request = None  # Line 195\nself.git_config = {}        # Line 196\nself.consolidated_findings  # Referenced in multiple methods\n```\n**Impact:** State persistence across invocations risks data corruption in concurrent scenarios. The lack of explicit state reset mechanisms could cause memory leaks in long-running processes.\n**Recommendation:** Implement immutable state containers with clear scoping and add explicit state reset methods between workflow runs.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort, High benefit.\n\n### 3. Workflow Brittleness Through Over-Prescription\n**Insight:** Excessive step enforcement creates UX friction without proportional value.\n**Evidence:** The tool mandates rigid step sequences with forceful language:\n```python\nnext_steps = (\n    f\"MANDATORY: DO NOT call the {self.get_name()} tool again immediately. \"\n    f\"CRITICAL AWARENESS: You need to discover all git repositories...\"\n)  # Lines 613-621\n```\n**Impact:** Overly prescriptive guidance frustrates experienced developers and reduces tool adoption. The \"forced pause\" approach (line 6) contradicts modern CI/CD efficiency needs.\n**Recommendation:** Introduce a \"quick mode\" for experienced users that bypasses step enforcement while maintaining validation rigor.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium benefit.\n\n### 4. Configuration Sprawl and Maintainability Debt\n**Insight:** Massive configuration dictionaries create cognitive load and update risks.\n**Evidence:** The `PRECOMMIT_WORKFLOW_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS` dictionary (lines 35-122) contains 22 verbose descriptions, each with multi-line strings. For example:\n```python\n\"step\": (\n    \"Describe what you're currently investigating for pre-commit validation by thinking deeply...\"\n    # 11 additional lines of description\n),\n```\n**Impact:** Configuration changes require navigating 87 lines of tightly coupled text, increasing error risk. This violates single responsibility principles.\n**Recommendation:** Extract field descriptions into a structured YAML/JSON configuration file with validation.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High benefit.\n\n### 5. Hidden Dependencies and Framework Coupling\n**Insight:** Tight coupling to undocumented framework components reduces portability.\n**Evidence:** Critical dependencies like `WorkflowTool` (line 30), `WorkflowRequest` (line 28), and `WorkflowSchemaBuilder` (line 245) are imported without context. The tool assumes framework-specific behaviors:\n```python\nreturn WorkflowSchemaBuilder.build_schema(\n    tool_specific_fields=precommit_field_overrides,\n    model_field_schema=self.get_model_field_schema(),\n    auto_mode=self.is_effective_auto_mode(),\n    tool_name=self.get_name(),\n)  # Lines 333-338\n```\n**Impact:** Framework changes could break the tool. The lack of abstraction layers makes testing and reuse difficult.\n**Recommendation:** Introduce adapter patterns for framework interactions and document all external dependencies.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort, Medium benefit.\n\n## Quick Wins\n- **Simplify Confidence Levels**: Reduce 7 confidence states (line 283) to 3 (low/medium/high) to decrease decision overhead\n- **Add Input Validation**: Implement Pydantic validators for critical fields like `path` (line 178) beyond basic presence checks\n- **Extract Magic Strings**: Replace hardcoded status strings (e.g., \"validation_complete_ready_for_commit\" at line 514) with enums\n- **Add State Reset Method**: Implement `reset_state()` to clear `initial_request` and `git_config` between runs\n- **Optimize Field Descriptions**: Cut verbose descriptions by 50% while preserving critical guidance\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1: Decoupling** (2-3 weeks)\n   - Extract configuration to external files\n   - Implement adapter pattern for framework dependencies\n   - Add comprehensive state management\n\n2. **Phase 2: UX Modernization** (3-4 weeks)\n   - Develop \"quick mode\" for experienced users\n   - Create progressive disclosure for complex options\n   - Implement workflow templates for common scenarios\n\n3. **Phase 3: Performance Optimization** (4-6 weeks)\n   - Add incremental analysis for large repositories\n   - Implement caching for repeated validations\n   - Introduce parallel processing for multi-repo analysis\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate Actions** (1-2 days):\n   - Replace manual schema generation with Pydantic's `model_json_schema()`\n   - Add `reset_state()` method to clear instance variables\n   - Create enums for status strings and confidence levels\n\n2. **Short-Term Improvements** (1-2 weeks):\n   - Extract field descriptions to YAML configuration\n   - Implement basic input validation beyond presence checks\n   - Add comprehensive logging for state transitions\n\n3. **Strategic Assessment** (2-3 weeks):\n   - Conduct user interviews to identify workflow pain points\n   - Prototype \"quick mode\" functionality\n   - Develop framework adapter interfaces\n\nThis analysis reveals that while the precommit tool addresses a critical need for systematic validation, its current implementation prioritizes comprehensiveness over maintainability and usability. The recommended changes focus on reducing complexity while preserving the tool's core strengths in structured validation guidance.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview  \nThe `provider_capabilities` tool is a lightweight, read-only diagnostic helper that surfaces environment readiness without exposing secrets. It is architecturally sound for its narrow purpose, but the current implementation couples itself to a hard-coded provider list, relies on a fragile 90-second “bucket” cache, and silently swallows all registry failures—introducing stealth UX degradation and minor operational risk as the MCP server grows beyond two providers.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Hard-Coded Provider Coupling\n**Insight:** Lines 73-84 enumerate exactly two providers (KIMI/GLM) and their bespoke keys; any new provider requires editing this file.  \n**Evidence:**  \n```python\n\"KIMI_API_KEY_present\": present(\"KIMI_API_KEY\"),\n\"GLM_API_KEY_present\": present(\"GLM_API_KEY\"),\n...\n```  \n**Impact:** New providers or renamed env-vars force code changes, defeating the “plugin” spirit of the broader tool-registry design.  \n**Recommendation:** Shift to a convention-based scan: `*_API_KEY`, `*_API_URL`, plus an optional allow-list in settings.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High\n\n### 2. Silent Failure Anti-Pattern\n**Insight:** The `try/except: pass` on lines 88 & 100 hides registry or import errors, so users see an empty tools list with no indication of mis-configuration.  \n**Evidence:**  \n```python\nexcept Exception:\n    pass\n```  \n**Impact:** Troubleshooting onboarding issues becomes guess-work; failures accumulate unseen.  \n**Recommendation:** Log the exception at `WARNING` level and return `tools_error` field in the JSON payload.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High\n\n### 3. Time-Bucket Cache Instability\n**Insight:** The 90-second “time//90” cache key (lines 58-65) is shared across all instances, has no TTL eviction, and is reset on any import error, making cache hits non-deterministic.  \n**Evidence:**  \n```python\ncache_key = f\"pcap:{int(time()//90)}\"\n```  \n**Impact:** Repeated calls in the same minute may still miss cache; concurrency could corrupt the global.  \n**Recommendation:** Remove the cache entirely (env inspection is nanoseconds) or replace with an in-memory TTL cache with explicit lock.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 4. UX Parameter Overload\n**Insight:** Three boolean flags (`include_tools`, `show_advanced`, `invalidate_cache`) expose internal mechanics that most callers never vary.  \n**Impact:** API surface is larger than necessary; users must learn semantics of “advanced” vs “core”.  \n**Recommendation:** Collapse to a single `detail` enum (`core | all`) and drop the cache invalidation flag once cache is removed.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 5. Missing Security Sanity Check\n**Insight:** While secrets are not emitted, the tool happily reports key *presence* and full URL strings.  \n**Impact:** Reveals infrastructure details to any client with access to the MCP endpoint; aids reconnaissance.  \n**Recommendation:** Allow-list env-keys via configuration; redact URL paths if they contain internal hosts.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / Medium\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Replace `try/except: pass` with `logger.warning(\"ToolRegistry failed\", exc_info=True)`  \n- Delete the home-grown cache block (lines 55-66) – cost is negligible  \n- Add unit test asserting JSON shape and non-leakage of real keys  \n- Document the expected env-var naming convention in README so new providers need zero code changes\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. Introduce a `ProviderManifest` pydantic model that declares required env-vars per provider; registry auto-discovers manifests and feeds the capabilities tool.  \n2. Surface last-successful-call timestamps and health status for each provider endpoint (opt-in) to turn the tool into a mini health-check dashboard.  \n3. Publish the JSON schema for the capabilities payload as an OpenAPI example so IDE plugins can auto-generate client bindings.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Refactor env-summary logic to iterate over `*_API_KEY` pattern instead of hard-coded list (Medium effort, High payoff).  \n2. Remove or replace the time-bucket cache and add structured logging for registry failures (Low effort, High payoff).  \n3. Write a single integration test that spins up the MCP server with dummy env-vars and asserts the returned JSON contains expected keys but no secrets (Low effort, guards against regression).",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe `ProviderCapabilitiesTool` demonstrates a focused, secure approach to summarizing provider configurations without exposing secrets. Its strengths include clear responsibility isolation, safe data handling, and pragmatic caching. However, it exhibits architectural fragility through global state management, silent failure modes, and tight coupling to environment variables, which could undermine stability and maintainability as the system scales.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Global State Race Condition Risk\n**Insight:** Thread-unsafe global caching creates race conditions in concurrent execution environments.  \n**Evidence:**  \n```python\nglobal _PCAP_CACHE  # LINE 59\nif invalidate_cache:\n    _PCAP_CACHE = None  # LINE 61\n```  \n**Impact:** Concurrent requests could corrupt cache state, causing inconsistent responses or crashes in multi-threaded MCP servers.  \n**Recommendation:** Replace global cache with thread-safe alternatives (e.g., `functools.lru_cache` or Redis-backed caching).  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High benefit.\n\n### 2. Silent Failure Masking\n**Insight:** Broad exception swallowing hides critical failures and creates operational blind spots.  \n**Evidence:**  \n```python\nexcept Exception:  # LINE 100\n    pass  # Silent failure\n```  \n**Impact:** Tool registry failures silently return empty tool lists, misleading operators about system state and delaying incident detection.  \n**Recommendation:** Implement structured error logging and return explicit error indicators in JSON responses.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High benefit.\n\n### 3. Hardcoded Environment Coupling\n**Insight:** Direct environment variable access creates tight coupling and inhibits extensibility.  \n**Evidence:**  \n```python\nenv_summary = {\n    \"KIMI_API_KEY_present\": present(\"KIMI_API_KEY\"),  # LINE 73\n    \"GLM_API_KEY_present\": present(\"GLM_API_KEY\"),    # LINE 74\n    # ... 8 more hardcoded variables\n}\n```  \n**Impact:** Adding new providers requires code changes, violating open/closed principles and increasing regression risk.  \n**Recommendation:** Abstract environment checks into a provider registry pattern loaded from configuration.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, Medium benefit.\n\n### 4. Inefficient Cache Granularity\n**Insight:** Coarse-grained time-based caching wastes resources for unchanged configurations.  \n**Evidence:**  \n```python\ncache_key = f\"pcap:{int(time()//90)}\"  # 90-second buckets (LINE 58)\n```  \n**Impact:** Forces recomputation every 90 seconds even when configurations are static, increasing latency and resource usage.  \n**Recommendation:** Implement content-based caching (e.g., hash environment state) or event-driven invalidation.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, Medium benefit.\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Replace `except Exception: pass` with context-aware error logging  \n- Add thread-safe locking around `_PCAP_CACHE` operations  \n- Include timestamp in cache keys to avoid stale data after service restarts  \n- Expose cache hit/miss metrics for operational monitoring  \n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1:** Introduce provider abstraction layer with configuration-driven capability discovery  \n2. **Phase 2:** Integrate with centralized configuration management (e.g., Consul/etcd)  \n3. **Phase 3:** Implement capability streaming for real-time updates instead of polling  \n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate Refactor:** Eliminate global state and implement thread-safe caching  \n2. **Error Handling:** Add structured logging and explicit error responses within 1 sprint  \n3. **Provider Abstraction:** Design provider registry interface to decouple environment access  \n\nThis analysis reveals that while the tool meets immediate functional requirements, its current implementation patterns introduce systemic risks that could impede scalability and operational stability. Prioritizing thread safety and observability will provide immediate risk reduction while enabling future extensibility.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview  \nThe refactor tool is a well-intentioned attempt to wrap an interactive, multi-step code-quality investigation inside a single CLI command. It succeeds at forcing agents to pause, inspect, and document findings, but the implementation is over-engineered: 700+ lines of configuration, string templating, and inheritance hooks that duplicate logic already expressed in doc-strings and Pydantic validators. The result is high UX friction (agents must learn a 19-field schema and a 4-state confidence machine), high maintenance cost (every new workflow needs a parallel class hierarchy), and latent runtime risk (validators that only fire on step 1, silent temperature overrides, and file-path handling that assumes POSIX). The architecture is not intrinsically flawed, yet its complexity grows linearly with every new workflow type, making long-term evolution expensive.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Configuration Overload & UX Complexity\n**Insight:** 19 request fields, 14 of them mandatory per step, force agents to act as state machines instead of engineers.  \n**Evidence:** `RefactorRequest` (lines 122-171) plus `REFACTOR_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS` (lines 36-119) contain ~4 000 characters of guidance that must be re-read each call.  \n**Impact:** Onboarding friction, high token burn, and prompt-engineering errors that surface only at runtime.  \n**Recommendation:** Collapse to four fields: `files`, `intent`, `findings`, `done?`. Derive the rest (step counter, confidence, issue list) inside the tool.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High\n\n### 2. Inheritance Depth & Parallel Hierarchy Explosion\n**Insight:** Every new workflow clones 30+ hook methods (`get_completion_status`, `get_completion_data_key`, …) that differ only by a noun.  \n**Evidence:** `RefactorTool` overrides 18 abstract methods; `WorkflowTool` base already contains 25.  \n**Impact:** Adding the next workflow (e.g., “security-audit”) will duplicate another 700-line module; divergence is inevitable.  \n**Recommendation:** Replace inheritance with composition: a single `WorkflowEngine` class plus a JSON manifest per workflow (fields, prompts, required-actions).  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High / High\n\n### 3. Silent Temperature & Model Override\n**Insight:** `temperature` is excluded from the schema (line 159) but still honoured via `get_default_temperature()` (line 217), creating an invisible contract.  \n**Evidence:** If a caller passes `temperature=0.2` it is silently dropped; the agent believes it is using 0.2 but receives `TEMPERATURE_ANALYTICAL`.  \n**Impact:** Non-deterministic behaviour that is almost impossible to debug from the outside.  \n**Recommendation:** Either surface `temperature` in the schema or remove the override entirely; do not hide runtime parameters.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 4. Step-1-Only Validation Hole\n**Insight:** `validate_step_one_requirements()` (lines 164-170) guarantees `relevant_files` only on step 1; later steps can submit empty file lists without error.  \n**Evidence:** Validator is decorated with `model_validator(mode=\"after\")` but checks `step_number == 1`.  \n**Impact:** Agents can “complete” an analysis that references zero files, producing vacuous expert calls.  \n**Recommendation:** Make `relevant_files` mandatory for every step, or relax the constraint and allow the tool to re-use previous step’s list.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 5. File-Path Assumption & Cross-Platform Risk\n**Insight:** All path fields are typed `list[str]` with no further validation; Windows agents can pass mixed separators or glob patterns that break downstream embedders.  \n**Evidence:** Doc-strings insist on “absolute paths, do not clip” (line 73) but no `Path.resolve()` or `Path.is_absolute()` check exists.  \n**Impact:** Runtime file-not-found errors that surface only during expert analysis embedding.  \n**Recommendation:** Add `BeforeValidator` that converts to `Path` objects and normalises; reject relative paths early.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High\n\n### 6. Confidence State Machine Leakage\n**Insight:** The four-state confidence enum (`exploring`, `incomplete`, `partial`, `complete`) is duplicated in three places: model field, schema enum, and hard-coded strings in `should_call_expert_analysis()`.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 139-140, 272-273, 374-375.  \n**Impact:** Adding a new state requires touching no less than six locations; inevitable skew.  \n**Recommendation:** Define a single `Confidence` StrEnum and import everywhere; remove string literals.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:**",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe refactor tool demonstrates a well-structured, systematic approach to code analysis with comprehensive state tracking and expert validation integration. Its strengths lie in the flexible workflow design, multi-type refactoring support, and confidence-based optimization. However, significant architectural complexity, rigid step enforcement, and potential UX friction points create maintainability risks and could hinder adoption. The tool shows promise but requires strategic simplification and flexibility enhancements to achieve long-term viability.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Architectural Overengineering\n**Insight:** Excessive abstraction layers and customization hooks create unnecessary complexity that impedes maintainability without clear current need.\n**Evidence:** The `RefactorTool` class contains 15+ override methods (lines 506-688) for minor behavioral variations like `get_completion_status`, `get_skip_reason`, and `customize_workflow_response`. The field description dictionary spans 80+ lines (lines 36-119), and the input schema builder requires complex override mappings (lines 237-317).\n**Impact:** High maintenance burden due to scattered customization logic; steep learning curve for new developers; increased risk of inconsistencies when modifying behavior. The tool's complexity appears disproportionate to its core refactoring analysis purpose.\n**Recommendation:** Consolidate customization logic into configuration-driven approach rather than method overrides. Reduce field descriptions to essential guidance. Implement a plugin system for future extensions instead of built-in hooks.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff in maintainability and developer velocity.\n\n### 2. Rigid Workflow Enforcement\n**Insight:** Mandatory step-by-step investigation with forced pauses creates UX friction and inefficiency for experienced users.\n**Evidence:** Step guidance contains imperative language like \"MANDATORY: DO NOT call the refactor tool again immediately\" (lines 599-600) and \"STOP! Do NOT call refactor again yet\" (lines 612-613). The workflow requires manual progression through steps even for simple refactoring tasks.\n**Impact:** Significant productivity loss for routine refactoring; user frustration from artificial pacing; potential abandonment of tool for time-sensitive tasks. The rigidity contradicts the tool's goal of improving development efficiency.\n**Recommendation:** Introduce \"express mode\" for experienced users that bypasses forced pauses while maintaining analysis quality checks. Allow batch processing of multiple investigation steps with consolidated reporting.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; High payoff in user adoption and productivity.\n\n### 3. Cognitive Overload in Input Schema\n**Insight:** Excessive required fields and verbose descriptions create high cognitive friction during tool interaction.\n**Evidence:** The `RefactorRequest` model requires 15 fields per step (lines 122-170), with field descriptions averaging 5+ lines each. The `step` field description alone spans 14 lines (lines 37-50) with complex nested instructions.\n**Impact:** High barrier to entry; increased error rates in field completion; reduced tool utilization due to perceived complexity. The verbose guidance may paradoxically reduce comprehension by burying critical information.\n**Recommendation:** Implement progressive disclosure - show only essential fields initially with optional advanced fields. Replace lengthy descriptions with concise bullet points + contextual help links. Introduce field validation with real-time feedback.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff in usability and error reduction.\n\n### 4. Fragile Confidence Threshold Logic\n**Insight:** The confidence-based expert analysis bypass lacks validation mechanisms, risking incomplete analyses.\n**Evidence:** The `should_call_expert_analysis` method (lines 363-382) skips expert validation solely based on `confidence == \"complete\"` without verifying analysis completeness. No objective metrics validate the user's confidence assessment (e.g., minimum files examined, issue coverage).\n**Impact:** Potential for premature analysis termination; missed refactoring opportunities; false confidence in suboptimal results. This undermines the tool's core value proposition of thorough analysis.\n**Recommendation:** Implement objective completeness checks (e.g., minimum file coverage, issue distribution across types) before allowing confidence override. Add confidence calibration through historical accuracy tracking.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; Critical payoff in analysis reliability.\n\n### 5. Limited Automation Integration\n**Insight:** Manual investigation focus misses opportunities for automated code analysis integration.\n**Evidence:** Required actions emphasize manual processes like \"Read and understand the code files\" and \"Examine the overall structure\" (lines 324-330). No integration points for linters, static analyzers, or code quality metrics exist in the workflow.\n**Impact:** Inefficient use of developer time; inconsistent analysis quality; missed opportunities for scalable codebase assessment. The tool fails to leverage existing automation ecosystem.\n**Recommendation:** Integrate with static analysis tools (e.g., linters, complexity analyzers) to auto-generate initial findings. Add plugin architecture for custom analysis tools. Provide automated dependency mapping for decomposition analysis.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort; High payoff in analysis efficiency and consistency.\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Simplify field descriptions to 1-2 concise sentences each with expandable details\n- Add visual progress indicators showing analysis completion percentage\n- Implement keyboard shortcuts for common workflow actions\n- Provide pre-filled templates for common refactoring scenarios\n- Add export functionality for findings in multiple formats (JSON, Markdown, PDF)\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1:** Implement express mode and progressive disclosure to reduce UX friction\n2. **Phase 2:** Integrate automated analysis tools and build plugin architecture\n3. **Phase 3:** Develop ML-assisted refactoring recommendations based on historical patterns\n4. **Phase 4:** Create collaborative analysis features for team-based refactoring projects\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Prioritize architectural simplification** by consolidating customization hooks and reducing method overrides to improve maintainability\n2. **Implement express mode workflow** within 2 sprints to address UX friction points and improve adoption\n3. **Develop automated analysis integration roadmap** with specific tool integration milestones for the next quarter\n\nThe refactor tool shows strong conceptual foundation but requires strategic simplification and flexibility enhancements to achieve sustainable adoption. Focus should shift from comprehensive feature coverage to streamlined user experience and maintainable architecture.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview  \nThe `secaudit` tool is a well-intentioned security-audit orchestrator that inherits from a generic `WorkflowTool` base. It succeeds in providing a repeatable, step-wise OWASP-flavoured checklist and a rich prompt bundle for LLM-based security triage. However, the implementation is **over-engineered** (≈ 800 lines of mostly boiler-plate), **couples UI orchestration to security logic**, and **lacks run-time safety rails** (no time-outs, no circuit-breakers, no payload size guards). These traits make the component a future maintenance sink and a latent reliability risk once large mono-repos or recursive dependency trees are audited.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Excessive Configuration Surface & Schema Duplication  \n**Insight:** 130-line field-description table + 70-line Pydantic model + 70-line JSON-schema builder re-declare the same 15 security parameters.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 37-131 vs. 134-196 vs. 451-541.  \n**Impact:** Every new parameter triples maintenance cost; schema drift inevitable.  \n**Recommendation:** Collapse into a single `SecurityAuditParams` Pydantic model and auto-generate the JSON schema with `model_json_schema()`.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High  \n\n### 2. Hard-coded 6-Step Waterfall Prescribes Workflow Velocity  \n**Insight:** `get_required_actions()` (lines 277-324) locks the CLI agent into an immutable 6-step sequence regardless of repo size or risk profile.  \n**Impact:** Agents waste cycles on irrelevant steps (e.g., dependency scan on a static HTML site).  \n**Recommendation:** Replace the `if/elif` ladder with a strategy registry (`Dict[AuditFocus, List[Check]]`) and let the first step prune the checklist based on detected stack & focus.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High  \n\n### 3. No Guard-rails Against Run-away Token Usage  \n**Insight:** Files are blindly embedded (line 367-369) and findings concatenated forever; no max-file-count, max-bytes, or max-steps cut-off.  \n**Impact:** A single call on a 2 GB node_modules folder will OOM the host or exhaust token budget.  \n**Recommendation:** Add `MAX_FILES=150`, `MAX_BYTES=5 MiB`, `MAX_STEPS=10` class constants and short-circuit with a warning status.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High  \n\n### 4. Mixed Presentation & Business Logic  \n**Insight:** String templates such as `get_completion_next_steps_message()` (lines 601-619) contain CLI instructions, markdown, and status flags.  \n**Impact:** UI text churn forces code re-test; hard to localize or re-skin.  \n**Recommendation:** Externalise user-facing strings to a `secaudit.responses.yaml` and keep the tool returning pure data objects.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium  \n\n### 5. Silent Failure when Compliance Tag Unknown  \n**Insight:** Validator (lines 191-194) only logs a warning for an invalid compliance tag and continues.  \n**Impact:** Audit report may claim “GDPR review done” while having skipped controls.  \n**Recommendation:** Raise `ValueError` instead of `logger.warning`; fail fast.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High  \n\n### 6. Inheritance Depth Hampers Unit Testing  \n**Insight:** Seven hook methods (`should_call_expert_analysis`, `prepare_expert_analysis_context`, …) are spread across 200 lines solely to tweak base-class behaviour.  \n**Impact:** To unit-test one variant you instantiate the whole 800-line class; mocks become brittle.  \n**Recommendation:** Extract a `SecurityExpertGateway` service; leave the tool as a thin coordinator.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / Medium  \n\n---\n\n## Quick Wins  \n- Delete `SECAUDIT_WORKFLOW_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS` and reuse Field descriptions from the Pydantic model.  \n- Replace 60-line `get_description()` string with a single concise sentence; append dynamic examples at run-time.  \n- Add `@lru_cache` to `get_input_schema()`—schema never changes per session.  \n- Convert `severity_groups` (line 410) to `defaultdict(list)` to remove four repetitive keys.  \n- Swap `logger.warning` for `logger.info` on missing `security_scope`; it is not a warning-worthy event.  \n\n---\n\n## Long-Term Road-map (If Tool Proves Traction)  \n1. **Plug-in Architecture:** Let security teams drop in custom checks as `.py` or `.rego` files without touching the core.  \n2. **Parallelisable Steps:** Allow agent to run dependency-check, secret-scan, and SCA in concurrent coroutines; aggregate results before step 5.  \n3",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe secaudit tool demonstrates a sophisticated security audit workflow architecture with strong methodological rigor, but suffers from significant overengineering that impacts maintainability and usability. While its systematic step-by-step approach and comprehensive security coverage are notable strengths, the excessive abstraction layers, complex state management, and rigid workflow enforcement create substantial technical debt. The tool's architecture shows misalignment with practical deployment needs, favoring theoretical completeness over operational efficiency.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Overengineering and Excessive Abstraction\n**Insight:** The tool introduces unnecessary complexity through multiple inheritance layers and excessive method overriding, creating a brittle architecture that's difficult to maintain and extend.\n**Evidence:** The `SecauditTool` class (lines 199-785) overrides 20+ methods from `WorkflowTool`, with security-specific logic scattered across numerous hooks. The field descriptions dictionary (lines 37-131) contains 15+ verbose entries that duplicate validation logic found in the Pydantic model.\n**Impact:** This complexity increases cognitive load, slows onboarding, and creates fragility where changes to base classes could break security-specific functionality. The 785-line implementation suggests the tool is trying to solve too many hypothetical scenarios.\n**Recommendation:** Simplify by consolidating security-specific logic into dedicated service classes rather than method overrides. Reduce field descriptions to essential validations only.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort, High payoff (improved maintainability and reduced bug surface).\n\n### 2. Rigid Workflow Enforcement Creates UX Friction\n**Insight:** The tool's forced pauses between steps and recursive call prevention mechanisms create unnecessary user friction while adding minimal security value.\n**Evidence:** Step guidance messages contain aggressive warnings like \"MANDATORY: DO NOT call the tool again immediately\" (line 650) and \"NO recursive calls without actual investigation work\" (line 682). The tool implements multiple safeguards against immediate recursion (lines 660-684).\n**Impact:** This paternalistic approach frustrates experienced users and limits automation potential. The complexity of managing step numbers, confidence levels, and backtrack states creates cognitive overhead without corresponding security benefits.\n**Recommendation:** Replace forced pauses with optional checkpoints. Allow experienced users to bypass pauses while maintaining safeguards for novice users.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff (improved user experience and adoption).\n\n### 3. Inefficient State Management and Data Handling\n**Insight:** The tool maintains complex state across multiple instance variables with inconsistent initialization and update patterns.\n**Evidence:** State is managed through `initial_request` (line 211), `security_config` (line 212), and `consolidated_findings` (line 723). Security configuration is duplicated in `prepare_step_data` (lines 562-568) and `customize_workflow_response` (lines 697-703).\n**Impact:** This scattered state management increases bug risk, makes testing difficult, and creates memory inefficiencies. The tool lacks clear state transition validation.\n**Recommendation:** Implement a centralized state machine pattern with explicit transitions and validation. Consolidate all state-related operations into a dedicated state management service.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff (reduced bugs and improved testability).\n\n### 4. Incomplete Security Validation\n**Insight:** Despite being a security audit tool, its own validation logic contains gaps that could lead to false negatives in security assessments.\n**Evidence:** The `validate_security_audit_request` method (lines 182-196) only validates compliance requirements against a hardcoded set (line 191) and doesn't validate severity levels or threat models. The confidence scale (lines 99-104) includes subjective levels without clear criteria.\n**Impact:** This could allow invalid security configurations to pass through, potentially missing critical vulnerabilities or generating false confidence in assessments.\n**Recommendation:** Strengthen validation with comprehensive security checks. Implement objective criteria for confidence levels and validate all security-specific parameters.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff (improved assessment accuracy).\n\n### 5. Performance and Scalability Concerns\n**Insight:** The tool's context preparation and string manipulation approaches create performance bottlenecks for large-scale audits.\n**Evidence:** The `prepare_expert_analysis_context` method (lines 344-398) builds large strings through concatenation (line 398) and processes all findings in memory. The `_format_security_issues` method (lines 400-427) uses nested loops without optimization.\n**Impact:** For large codebases, this could lead to memory exhaustion and slow response times. The tool lacks pagination or streaming capabilities for handling extensive audit results.\n**Recommendation:** Implement streaming context generation and optimize string operations. Add support for incremental processing of large audit scopes.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, Medium payoff (improved performance for large audits).\n\n## Quick Wins\n- **Simplify field descriptions** by removing redundant text and focusing on essential validation only\n- **Consolidate security configuration initialization** into a single method to eliminate duplication\n- **Add type hints** consistently throughout the codebase to improve maintainability\n- **Implement basic input sanitization** for security fields to prevent injection attacks\n- **Add configuration validation** for threat levels and severity filters to prevent invalid states\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1: Core Simplification** - Reduce inheritance complexity by extracting security logic into dedicated services. Implement centralized state management.\n2. **Phase 2: UX Enhancement** - Replace forced pauses with configurable checkpoints. Add automation-friendly interfaces.\n3. **Phase 3: Performance Optimization** - Implement streaming processing and memory-efficient data structures for large-scale audits.\n4. **Phase 4: Extensibility Framework** - Create plugin architecture for custom security rules and compliance frameworks.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate:** Consolidate duplicate security configuration logic and strengthen input validation\n2. **Short-term (2-4 weeks):** Refactor method overrides into composable security services to reduce inheritance complexity\n3. **Medium-term (1-2 months):** Implement flexible workflow controls to replace rigid pause enforcement while maintaining security rigor\n\nThe secaudit tool shows strong conceptual foundation but requires significant architectural simplification to achieve its potential as a practical security audit solution. The current implementation prioritizes comprehensive coverage over usability, creating unnecessary barriers to adoption and maintenance.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe `testgen` tool is a well-structured workflow orchestrator for AI-driven test generation, built on a solid inheritance hierarchy and clear separation of concerns. Its architecture promotes extensibility and consistent behavior across workflow tools. However, the implementation exhibits over-engineering in several areas—excessive configuration layers, speculative abstraction, and verbose documentation that obscures core logic—creating maintenance burden and cognitive overhead without proportional benefit. The tool’s UX complexity stems from an overly granular confidence model and forced step-wise progression that may frustrate users seeking rapid test generation.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Over-Engineered Configuration & Documentation Layer\n**Insight:** 36-line field description dict (`TESTGEN_WORKFLOW_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS`, lines 36-95) and 250-line schema builder indirection add verbosity without clear ROI.  \n**Evidence:**  \n```python\n\"step\": (\"What to analyze … after thinking carefully about what needs to be examined. \"\n         \"Consider code structure, business logic, critical paths, edge cases …\")\n```\n**Impact:** Onboarding friction, slower refactors, and inflated codebase; future contributors must read 3× more text to grasp intent.  \n**Recommendation:** Collapse descriptions to ≤120 chars each; inline them directly in Pydantic `Field(description=…)` and delete the dict.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High\n\n### 2. Speculative Abstraction in Workflow Base\n**Insight:** `WorkflowTool` base class (imported line 31) appears to provide generic orchestration yet every significant behavior is overridden in `TestGenTool`, suggesting the abstraction was premature.  \n**Evidence:** `prepare_prompt` returns empty string (line 574), `get_completion_status`, `get_completion_data_key`, etc. are all overridden.  \n**Impact:** Cognitive indirection, harder to trace execution, risk of base-class changes breaking unrelated tools.  \n**Recommendation:** Evaluate whether `WorkflowTool` truly offers reusable value; if not, flatten hierarchy and let `TestGenTool` own its logic.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High\n\n### 3. Granular Confidence Model Creates UX Drag\n**Insight:** Seven-level confidence enum (`exploring` → `certain`, lines 80-85) forces users into micro-gradations that don’t materially affect behavior except for the final “certain” skip.  \n**Evidence:** Only `request.confidence == \"certain\"` has special handling (line 397); other values funnel into same action lists.  \n**Impact:** Users must guess distinction between `very_high` vs `almost_certain`, slowing iteration; code paths proliferate without benefit.  \n**Recommendation:** Collapse to three levels: `investigating`, `reviewing`, `certain`.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 4. Mandatory Step-wise Progression Bottleneck\n**Insight:** Tool enforces sequential step lock-step (`step_number`, `total_steps`, `next_step_required`) even when the AI already has enough context to generate tests in one pass.  \n**Evidence:** `get_test_generation_step_guidance` emits 20-line CAPITALIZED warnings (lines 489-524) threatening recursion violations.  \n**Impact:** Latency inflation, token burn, user annoyance; contradicts “comprehensive” claim by throttling speed.  \n**Recommendation:** Allow “fast-path” parameter that skips to final step when coverage goals are met; keep step-wise mode for complex unknown codebases.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High\n\n### 5. String-Based Status Proliferation\n**Insight:** Status strings (`test_generation_complete_ready_for_implementation`, line 407) are hard-coded and mapped through multiple dicts (lines 538-546), creating fragile string coupling.  \n**Evidence:** Any rename requires touching 4+ locations; typos break downstream consumers.  \n**Impact:** Refactor risk, silent failures, harder static analysis.  \n**Recommendation:** Replace with `enum.StrEnum` constants exported from a single module.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Delete `TESTGEN_WORKFLOW_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS` dict; move concise descriptions inline with Pydantic fields.  \n- Replace seven-level confidence enum with three levels; migrate existing callers.  \n- Introduce `TestGenStatus` enum for all magic strings; remove ad-hoc mappings.  \n- Add `--fast` CLI flag that sets `total_steps=1` and short-circuits to completion when user already knows target files.  \n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Flatten inheritance:** Evaluate concrete reuse of `WorkflowTool`; if <20 % code is shared, remove base class and let each tool be self-contained.  \n2. **Streaming / incremental generation:** Support “live” test file emission as soon as each code unit is analyzed, reducing wait time.  \n3. **",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe TestGen tool implements a sophisticated step-by-step test generation workflow with expert validation capabilities. While it demonstrates strong architectural patterns through inheritance and modular design, it suffers from significant maintainability challenges due to excessive customization, hardcoded strings, and complex conditional logic. The tool's heavy reliance on external model calls and granular confidence levels introduces operational risks and UX complexity that could hinder adoption for simpler use cases.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Excessive Customization and Maintainability Debt\n**Insight:** The tool overrides 20+ methods from WorkflowTool with highly specialized logic, creating tight coupling and making future changes error-prone.\n**Evidence:** Lines 141-575 show extensive method overrides (get_completion_status, customize_workflow_response, get_step_guidance_message, etc.) with test-specific implementations. The status mapping at lines 538-543 hardcodes string transformations.\n**Impact:** Each workflow change requires updates across multiple overridden methods, increasing regression risk. The 575-line class violates single responsibility principle.\n**Recommendation:** Refactor to use composition over inheritance - extract test-specific behaviors into strategy classes. Replace hardcoded mappings with configuration-driven approaches.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort, High payoff (reduces maintenance burden by 60%+).\n\n### 2. Unconditional External Model Dependencies\n**Insight:** The tool always triggers expert analysis unless confidence is \"certain\", creating unnecessary cost and latency for simple test scenarios.\n**Evidence:** Lines 300-311 show `should_call_expert_analysis` returns True for any non-empty investigation. Line 358 forces system prompt embedding in all expert calls.\n**Impact:** Uncontrolled API costs and slow execution for basic test generation. No fallback mechanism when external services fail.\n**Recommendation:** Implement confidence-based thresholds (e.g., skip expert analysis for \"high\" confidence). Add circuit breakers and caching for repeated analysis.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff (reduces costs by 30-50% for simple cases).\n\n### 3. String Manipulation Bugs and Brittleness\n**Insight:** Critical string handling errors exist in summary generation, with hardcoded messages creating maintenance nightmares.\n**Evidence:** Line 352 contains `return \"\\\\n\".join(summary_parts)` - literal backslash-n instead of newline character. Lines 481-526 build complex guidance strings with embedded conditionals.\n**Impact:** Display corruption in investigation summaries. Any workflow wording change requires code redeployment.\n**Recommendation:** Fix newline bug immediately. Extract all user-facing strings to external templates with placeholder substitution.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff (prevents UI bugs and enables localization).\n\n### 4. UX Complexity from Over-Engineered Workflow\n**Insight:** The 7-level confidence system and mandatory multi-step process create friction for straightforward test generation.\n**Evidence:** Lines 80-86 define granular confidence levels (\"exploring\" to \"certain\"). Lines 488-524 force pauses with \"MANDATORY\" directives even for simple cases.\n**Impact:** Users abandon the tool for basic testing needs due to cognitive overhead. Step guidance messages feel robotic and inflexible.\n**Recommendation:** Introduce \"quick mode\" bypassing steps for simple functions. Collapse confidence levels to 3 tiers (low/medium/high).\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff (improves adoption for common use cases).\n\n### 5. Missing Operational Resilience\n**Insight:** No error handling for external dependencies or file processing failures, risking workflow crashes.\n**Evidence:** No try/catch blocks around expert analysis calls (lines 300-312). File path handling lacks validation (lines 64-73).\n**Impact:** Unhandled exceptions terminate test generation mid-workflow. Malformed file paths could cause security issues.\n**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive error handling with retry logic.

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe ThinkDeep tool is a well-structured workflow system for systematic investigation and deep reasoning. It demonstrates solid architectural patterns with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive state tracking, and extensible design. However, it exhibits signs of over-engineering with excessive configuration options, complex confidence state management, and potential performance bottlenecks in the expert analysis pipeline. The tool's strength lies in its systematic approach to investigation, but its complexity may hinder maintainability and user experience.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Over-Engineered Configuration Complexity\n**Insight:** The tool exposes 15+ configuration parameters with intricate validation rules and state dependencies, creating unnecessary cognitive overhead.\n**Evidence:** Lines 86-133 show confidence levels with 7 distinct states, temperature controls, thinking modes, web search toggles, and focus areas. The `customize_workflow_response` method (lines 224-288) contains nested try-catch blocks for parameter extraction.\n**Impact:** Increases onboarding time, raises error probability, and complicates testing without proportional value gain.\n**Recommendation:** Consolidate to 3-4 core parameters (confidence, focus_areas, context) and derive others intelligently based on use case patterns.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff\n\n### 2. Brittle Confidence State Management\n**Insight:** The confidence system creates circular dependencies where \"certain\" confidence bypasses expert validation, potentially allowing incomplete analyses to be marked as definitive.\n**Evidence:** Lines 291-294 show `should_skip_expert_analysis` returns True for \"certain\" confidence, while lines 92-93 warn against using \"certain\" unless analysis is complete.\n**Impact:** Risk of premature analysis termination and validation gaps in critical decision-making scenarios.\n**Recommendation:** Remove the \"certain\" confidence level entirely; require expert validation for all analyses or implement a minimum step threshold before allowing completion.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff\n\n### 3. Memory Leak Risk in State Accumulation\n**Insight:** The tool accumulates investigation state across steps without apparent cleanup mechanisms, risking memory growth in long-running analyses.\n**Evidence:** Lines 54-66 track all files_checked (including unrelated ones), and the consolidated_findings object appears to accumulate indefinitely across workflow steps.\n**Impact:** Potential memory exhaustion in extended investigations, especially with large codebases.\n**Recommendation:** Implement periodic state pruning, limit history retention to relevant findings only, and add memory usage monitoring.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, Medium payoff\n\n### 4. Inefficient Expert Analysis Triggering\n**Insight:** The expert analysis decision logic is scattered across multiple methods with overlapping responsibilities, creating performance overhead and maintenance complexity.\n**Evidence:** Lines 476-500 show `should_call_expert_analysis` with fallback logic, while lines 290-294 show separate skip logic, and lines 264-275 show completion detection.\n**Impact:** Reduces system responsiveness and increases cognitive load for maintainers.\n**Recommendation:** Centralize expert analysis triggering into a single deterministic method with clear state-based rules.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff\n\n### 5. UX Complexity in Step Guidance\n**Insight:** The step guidance system generates verbose, context-specific messages that may overwhelm users rather than guide them effectively.\n**Evidence:** Lines 535-587 show `get_step_guidance_message` with 7 confidence-based branches plus progress-based additions, creating potentially confusing guidance.\n**Impact:** Users may ignore guidance entirely or make suboptimal decisions due to information overload.\n**Recommendation:** Simplify to 3 guidance levels (early/mid/late stage) with concise, actionable prompts.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Remove the \"certain\" confidence level to eliminate validation bypass risk\n- Consolidate the 7 confidence states to 4 (exploring/low/medium/high)\n- Replace nested try-catch parameter extraction with a single safe getter method\n- Add memory limits to file tracking (max 100 files before cleanup)\n- Simplify step guidance to template-based responses\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1:** Implement configuration profiles (minimal/standard/comprehensive) to reduce parameter surface area\n2. **Phase 2:** Add state persistence and recovery mechanisms for long-running investigations\n3. **Phase 3:** Introduce adaptive thinking modes that automatically adjust based on investigation progress and findings complexity\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate:** Remove \"certain\" confidence level and consolidate confidence states to reduce complexity\n2. **Short-term:** Implement centralized expert analysis triggering and add memory management for state accumulation\n3. **Medium-term:** Create configuration profiles and simplify step guidance system\n\nThe tool's core architecture is sound, but strategic simplification will significantly improve maintainability and user experience while preserving its systematic investigation capabilities.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe ThinkDeep tool demonstrates a sophisticated architectural approach to systematic reasoning workflows, with strong capabilities in evidence-based investigation and confidence-driven analysis. However, the implementation reveals significant complexity in state management, workflow control, and configuration that may impact long-term maintainability and operational stability. Key strengths include its comprehensive investigation tracking and flexible expert validation integration, while primary risks center on potential state synchronization issues and over-engineered workflow customization.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. State Management Complexity\n**Insight:** The tool maintains multiple overlapping state representations (stored_request_params, work_history, consolidated_findings) without clear synchronization boundaries, risking inconsistent state during workflow execution.\n**Evidence:** Lines 161, 229-247, 269-275 show state stored in instance variables (stored_request_params) while also accessing request parameters and consolidated findings. The customize_workflow_response method (lines 224-288) manually synchronizes state between request objects and instance storage.\n**Impact:** High risk of state corruption during concurrent executions or complex workflows. This could lead to incorrect analysis results or workflow failures, particularly in multi-step scenarios where parameters change between steps.\n**Recommendation:** Implement a unified state management pattern (e.g., State Machine or Command Pattern) to centralize workflow state and eliminate redundant storage. Consolidate all state into a single immutable data structure per workflow instance.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (reduces bugs and simplifies reasoning).\n\n### 2. Over-Engineered Confidence Model\n**Insight:** The confidence progression system (lines 86-94, 431-472) introduces unnecessary complexity with 7 discrete levels, creating cognitive overhead for users and implementation burden without clear differentiation between adjacent levels.\n**Evidence:** The confidence field (lines 86-94) defines 7 states (exploring, low, medium, high, very_high, almost_certain, certain) with subtle differences. The get_required_actions method (lines 417-474) maps each confidence level to specific actions, but adjacent levels (e.g., very_high vs almost_certain) have overlapping guidance.\n**Impact:** Increases UX complexity and implementation fragility. Users may struggle to select appropriate confidence levels, and the fine-grained distinctions complicate workflow logic without proportional value.\n**Recommendation:** Simplify to 3-4 confidence levels (e.g., Investigating, Developing, Confident, Complete) with clearer behavioral distinctions. Remove redundant levels and consolidate similar action mappings.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (improves usability and reduces code complexity).\n\n### 3. Brittleness in Expert Analysis Integration\n**Insight:** The expert analysis customization (lines 320-369) tightly couples validation logic with specific prompt engineering, making the system vulnerable to model changes and difficult to adapt for new validation scenarios.\n**Evidence:** The customize_expert_analysis_prompt method (lines 320-369) hardcodes validation objectives and thinking context structure. The get_expert_analysis_instructions method (lines 359-369) assumes a fixed output format.\n**Impact:** Limits flexibility for different analysis types or model upgrades. Changes to expert model requirements could require extensive prompt re-engineering and testing.\n**Recommendation:** Decouple validation logic into pluggable strategies using a Strategy Pattern. Define interfaces for validation objectives and prompt customization, allowing different validation approaches to be registered dynamically.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (improves adaptability and reduces maintenance).\n\n### 4. Inefficient File Tracking Mechanism\n**Insight:** The dual file tracking system (files_checked vs relevant_files, lines 54-66) requires manual maintenance and duplicates effort without clear value separation, increasing cognitive load for users.\n**Evidence:** The ThinkDeepWorkflowRequest model (lines 54-66) defines two separate lists for tracking files, with only subtle differences in their descriptions. Users must manually maintain both lists during investigation.\n**Impact:** Increases user effort and potential for error. The distinction between \"checked\" and \"relevant\" files is ambiguous and may lead to inconsistent tracking.\n**Recommendation:** Consolidate into a single file list with relevance tagging (e.g., list of dicts with file path and relevance flag). Automatically infer relevance based on content analysis or user annotations.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (simplifies UX and reduces data redundancy).\n\n### 5. Missing Workflow Recovery Mechanisms\n**Insight:** The workflow lacks built-in recovery for failures or interruptions, risking loss of investigation progress and requiring users to restart complex analyses from scratch.\n**Evidence:** No checkpointing or persistence mechanisms are visible in the implementation. The backtrack_from_step feature (lines 97-103) only supports intentional backtracking, not recovery from failures.\n**Impact:** High risk of data loss and user frustration during long-running analyses. System crashes or network issues could result in complete loss of investigation progress.\n**Recommendation:** Implement periodic checkpointing of workflow state to persistent storage. Add recovery mechanisms to resume interrupted workflows from the last checkpoint.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (improves reliability and user experience).\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Simplify confidence levels from 7 to 4 (Investigating, Developing, Confident, Complete) to reduce complexity\n- Consolidate files_checked and relevant_files into a single list with relevance flags\n- Add input validation for step_number vs total_steps to prevent logical inconsistencies\n- Implement basic logging for workflow state transitions to aid debugging\n- Add default values for optional parameters to reduce boilerplate in common use cases\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1: State Management Refactoring** - Implement unified state management to eliminate synchronization issues\n2. **Phase 2: Validation Strategy Decoupling** - Extract expert analysis logic into pluggable strategies\n3. **Phase 3: Persistence and Recovery** - Add workflow checkpointing and recovery capabilities\n4. **Phase 4: Adaptive Confidence Model** - Implement dynamic confidence adjustment based on evidence quality\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate**: Simplify the confidence model and consolidate file tracking to reduce UX complexity\n2. **Short-term**: Refactor state management to eliminate synchronization risks\n3. **Medium-term**: Implement workflow persistence and recovery mechanisms for improved reliability\n\nThis analysis reveals that while ThinkDeep is architecturally sound in concept, its implementation complexity introduces significant maintainability and reliability risks. The recommended changes focus on simplification, state management improvements, and recovery mechanisms to enhance operational stability without sacrificing functionality.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe tracer tool is a self-contained, workflow-driven CLI utility that orchestrates step-by-step code-tracing sessions.  \nIt is well-layered (Pydantic models, base workflow mixin, mode-specific renderers) and keeps I/O and LLM calls outside its boundary, which aids testability.  \nMain strategic risks: (1) over-constrained UX that forces rigid step-wise pauses even for trivial traces, (2) 100 % deterministic output templates that will break on multi-language/poly-repo codebases, (3) no evidence of incremental result caching or partial-resume, so long traces pay repeated file-I/O cost, (4) implicit assumption that a single “confidence” string is enough to decide when the user is “done”.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Over-Specified Rendering Templates\n**Insight:** 570-line string literals in `_get_precision_rendering_instructions` and `_get_dependencies_rendering_instructions` mandate exact ASCII diagrams, arrow glyphs, and column alignment.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 567-671 and 673-749 hard-code “↓”, “→”, “┐”, “┤” and indentation rules.  \n**Impact:** Any repo with non-ASCII method names, wide Unicode glyphs, or different line-widths will produce mis-aligned output; maintenance burden is high (one formatting tweak touches 200+ lines).  \n**Recommendation:** Replace monolithic strings with a tiny internal DSL + renderer (e.g., `TracerFormatter` protocol) so each trace mode only declares nodes/edges and the renderer worries about alignment.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High\n\n### 2. Rigid Step-Wise Pauses Reduce Throughput\n**Insight:** `handle_work_continuation` (lines 412-479) always returns `pause_for_tracing` and a human-oriented “STOP!” message—even for tiny codebases.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 443-450, 454-459, 462-469 use capitalised “MANDATORY/WAIT!” language and forbid immediate re-entry.  \n**Impact:** CI or headless environments must fake user acknowledgement; power users suffer friction when they already know the code.  \n**Recommendation:** Add an optional `--auto` flag (or `trace_mode=auto`) that lets the caller stream steps back-to-back until confidence ≥ high; keep interactive mode as default.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High\n\n### 3. No Incremental Caching or Resumability\n**Insight:** Every step re-scans the same files because `files_checked` is only a list of paths, not a content-hash cache.  \n**Evidence:** `TracerRequest` keeps `files_checked: list[str]` (line 117) but no checksum or AST snapshot.  \n**Impact:** Re-tracing after adding one file repeats full I/O; large mono-repos pay seconds-to-minutes penalty each step.  \n**Recommendation:** Store a lightweight cache keyed by `(file_path, mtime, size)` and skip unchanged files; expose `continuation_id` to resume prior trace session.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / Medium\n\n### 4. Single “confidence” String Is Brittle Control Flow\n**Insight:** Business logic (`get_required_actions`, `handle_work_continuation`) branches on string equality of `confidence` which is typed as `Optional[str]`.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 313-339 compare `confidence in [\"exploring\", \"low\"]`; a typo or locale change silently alters behaviour.  \n**Impact:** Runtime mis-classification leads to wrong action list; hard to unit-test.  \n**Recommendation:** Convert to `Enum` (`ConfidenceLevel`) and enforce via Pydantic.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 5. Hidden Coupling to `systemprompts.TRACER_PROMPT`\n**Insight:** Line 31 imports a module-level constant that is not versioned alongside the tool.  \n**Evidence:** `get_system_prompt()` (line 208) returns the constant verbatim.  \n**Impact:** Prompt drift or length changes can break token budgets without code review.  \n**Recommendation:** Move prompt text into a `resources/` file hashed at startup; fail fast if hash changes unexpectedly (configuration-as-code).  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 6. Duplicated Exclusion Lists\n**Insight:** Same field names are excluded in three places: `TracerRequest` (lines 138-148), `get_input_schema` (lines 265-277), and `prepare_step_data` (lines 368-370).  \n**Evidence:** `\"issues_found\", \"hypothesis\", \"temperature\"` etc. repeated.  \n**Impact:** Adding one new base-tool field requires three edits; easy to miss.  \n**Recommendation:** Define one `TRACER_EXCLUDED_FIELDS` tuple and reuse everywhere.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Low\n\n## Quick",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe tracer tool demonstrates a well-structured workflow architecture for systematic code analysis, with clear separation between precision execution tracing and dependency mapping. However, it suffers from significant architectural complexity, rigid workflow enforcement, and maintainability challenges due to its monolithic design. The tool's self-contained nature is a strength, but its extensive hardcoded logic and lack of modularity create technical debt that will impede future evolution and scalability.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Monolithic Architecture Violates Single Responsibility\n**Insight:** The `TracerTool` class (lines 165-811) violates single responsibility principle by handling workflow management, state persistence, response formatting, and rendering instructions in a single 650+ line class.\n**Evidence:** \n- Lines 293-339: Workflow action generation mixed with confidence-level logic\n- Lines 567-749: 180+ lines of hardcoded rendering instructions embedded in the main class\n- Lines 378-550: Response building logic intertwined with workflow state management\n**Impact:** High coupling makes the system difficult to test, modify, and extend. Adding new trace modes requires modifying the core class, increasing regression risk.\n**Recommendation:** Decompose into focused components: `WorkflowEngine`, `TraceRenderer`, `StateManager`, and `ResponseBuilder`. Extract rendering instructions into configuration files.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff.\n\n### 2. Rigid Workflow Enforcement Creates UX Friction\n**Insight:** Mandatory pauses between steps (lines 442-450, 454-458) and strict step progression create artificial bottlenecks that frustrate experienced users.\n**Evidence:**\n```python\nresponse_data[\"next_steps\"] = (\n    f\"MANDATORY: DO NOT call the {self.get_name()} tool again immediately. You MUST first investigate \"\n    f\"the codebase to understand the target code. CRITICAL AWARENESS: You need to find and understand...\"\n)\n```\n**Impact:** Forces inefficient workflows even for simple traces, reducing productivity and user adoption. The tool's design prioritizes process over outcomes.\n**Recommendation:** Introduce a \"flex mode\" that allows experienced users to skip pauses while maintaining safeguards for novices. Add configurable step granularity.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff.\n\n### 3. State Management Lacks Persistence\n**Insight:** Critical tracing state (`trace_config`, `work_history`, `initial_request`) is stored only in memory (lines 177-178, 487-491) with no persistence mechanism.\n**Evidence:**\n```python\nself.trace_config = {\n    \"trace_mode\": request.trace_mode,\n    \"target_description\": request.target_description,\n}\n```\n**Impact:** Any system interruption loses all progress, making the tool unreliable for complex, multi-session traces. This limits scalability for large codebases.\n**Recommendation:** Implement checkpoint-based state persistence using JSON or SQLite. Add session resumption capabilities.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff.\n\n### 4. Overengineered Validation Creates Brittleness\n**Insight:** Complex field validation logic (lines 150-162) and extensive field exclusions (lines 265-277) create unnecessary coupling and maintenance overhead.\n**Evidence:**\n```python\nexcluded_workflow_fields = [\n    \"issues_found\",  # Tracing doesn't track issues\n    \"hypothesis\",    # Tracing doesn't use hypothesis\n    \"backtrack_from_step\",  # Tracing doesn't use backtracking\n]\n```\n**Impact:** Schema changes require coordinated updates across multiple exclusion lists, increasing regression risk. The validation logic is tightly coupled to implementation details.\n**Recommendation:** Replace exclusion lists with composition-based schema building. Use Pydantic's built-in field exclusion mechanisms instead of manual lists.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff.\n\n### 5. Hardcoded Rendering Instructions Limit Extensibility\n**Insight:** Rendering instructions are embedded as massive string literals (lines 567-749) with no templating or configuration support.\n**Evidence:** 180+ lines of hardcoded formatting rules in `_get_precision_rendering_instructions()` and `_get_dependencies_rendering_instructions()`.\n**Impact:** Adding new output formats or modifying existing ones requires code changes and redeployment. The system can't adapt to different user preferences or use cases.\n**Recommendation:** Extract rendering instructions into external YAML/JSON templates. Implement a pluggable renderer system with support for custom formats.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff.\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Add confidence level validation (lines 86-92) to prevent invalid states\n- Refactor required actions generation (lines 313-339) into a data-driven configuration\n- Implement basic logging for workflow state transitions\n- Add input sanitization for `target_description` to prevent injection attacks\n- Convert hardcoded status strings (lines 540-548) to an enum for type safety\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1: Core Refactoring** (3-4 weeks)\n   - Decompose monolithic class into focused components\n   - Implement state persistence layer\n   - Add configuration-driven rendering\n\n2. **Phase 2: UX Enhancement** (2-3 weeks)\n   - Introduce flexible workflow modes\n   - Add session management features\n   - Implement progress visualization\n\n3. **Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration** (4-6 weeks)\n   - Plugin architecture for custom analyzers\n   - Integration with version control systems\n   - Multi-language support expansion\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Prioritize Decomposition:** Begin extracting rendering logic and state management into separate modules to reduce coupling\n2. **Implement Persistence:** Add SQLite-based checkpointing to enable session resumption\n3. **User Validation:** Conduct usability testing to identify workflow friction points and flex mode requirements\n\nThe tracer tool shows strong architectural intent but requires significant refactoring to achieve maintainability and scalability. The monolithic design and rigid workflow enforcement are the most critical risks that must be addressed to support long-term evolution.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe version tool is a lightweight, read-only utility that cleanly surfaces build and runtime metadata.  \nIts architecture is sound—no external model calls, minimal I/O, and graceful degradation when offline.  \nHowever, it embeds three systemic liabilities: (1) hard-wired GitHub URL that will break on repo rename or fork, (2) runtime import side-effects that couple the tool to the running server singleton, and (3) provider-configuration enumeration that duplicates logic already owned by the registry. These issues are low-risk today but become blockers when the project scales to multiple distributions, containers, or private deployments.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Brittle Update-Check Endpoint\n**Insight:** Line 93 hard-codes “BeehiveInnovations/zen-mcp-server”; any repo move, fork, or enterprise mirror invalidates the check and logs a warning that users cannot suppress.  \n**Evidence:**  \n```python\ngithub_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BeehiveInnovations/zen-mcp-server/main/config.py\"\n```  \n**Impact:** Silent feature loss in forks; support burden increases when users see perpetual “check failed” messages.  \n**Recommendation:** Move URL to `config.py` or an env var with a fallback “disable” flag; inject via DI in `__init__`.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High\n\n### 2. Tight Runtime Coupling to Server Singleton\n**Insight:** Lines 203-206 import the live `server` module at runtime to extract client context, assuming the process is an MCP server and not a CLI or test runner.  \n**Evidence:**  \n```python\nimport server as server_module\nclient_info = get_client_info_from_context(server_module.server)\n```  \n**Impact:** Prevents reuse of the tool in offline scripts, unit tests, or future headless distributions; import may raise `AttributeError` or circular imports as the codebase grows.  \n**Recommendation:** Accept an optional `context` parameter in `execute` and let the caller inject client metadata; keep the tool pure.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High\n\n### 3. Duplicate Provider-Introspection Logic\n**Insight:** Lines 227-263 re-implement provider enumeration and status formatting that the `ModelProviderRegistry` already exposes.  \n**Evidence:** Local lists `provider_types`/`provider_names` must be kept in sync with registry additions.  \n**Impact:** Double source of truth; missing or reordered entries produce misleading “not configured” messages.  \n**Recommendation:** Add `registry.get_provider_summary()` returning a list of `(name, configured)` tuples; let the tool simply iterate and render.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 4. Version Parsing Reinvents Packaging Standards\n**Insight:** Lines 34-55 implement custom tuple parsing instead of using `packaging.version.Version`, which handles pre-releases, local segments, and edge cases.  \n**Impact:** Future versions like “1.2.3b1” or “1.2.3+gpu” will mis-compare; silent logic bug.  \n**Recommendation:** Replace `parse_version` with `packaging.version.parse`; drop bespoke code.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 5. Silent Failure on Missing urllib\n**Insight:** Lines 16-22 set `HAS_URLLIB = False` if import fails, but urllib is part of CPython stdlib since 2.x; the guard is unnecessary and signals an environment that is effectively unsupported.  \n**Impact:** Code clutter; future readers waste time wondering when urllib could be absent.  \n**Recommendation:** Remove the conditional import and the flag; let the import raise if the runtime is truly broken.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Low\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Replace `parse_version` with `packaging.version.parse` (one-line change).  \n- Extract GitHub URL to `config.GITHUB_RAW_URL` with env override.  \n- Delete `HAS_URLLIB` branch and associated log noise.  \n- Add unit test that calls `VersionTool.execute({})` in isolation to prove no import side-effects.\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n- Introduce a `SystemInfoPort` interface so tools can receive host metadata (client, paths, feature flags) without importing the server.  \n- Centralise all “distribution” metadata (repo URL, docs URL, issue tracker) in a single `DistributionManifest` loaded at start-up; tools read from there.  \n- Adopt a plugin-style tool loader so version, health, and similar utilities are registered declaratively and remain side-effect free.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Open PR that externalises the GitHub URL and removes the urllib guard—low risk, immediate payoff.  \n2. Add isolated unit test coverage for `VersionTool.execute`; enforce no server import in CI.  \n3.",

    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe version tool implementation demonstrates solid architectural alignment with the MCP server framework, providing comprehensive system information in a user-friendly format. While it exhibits good error handling and modular design, critical risks include tight coupling with server internals, dead code from unused update functionality, and potential instability from broad exception handling. The tool effectively balances functionality with maintainability but requires strategic refactoring to address coupling concerns and improve operational resilience.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Tight Coupling to Server Internals\n**Insight**: Direct imports of server and provider modules create fragile dependencies that violate encapsulation principles.\n**Evidence**: \n```python\nimport server as server_module  # LINE 203\nfrom utils.client_info import format_client_info, get_client_info_from_context  # LINE 204\nfrom src.providers.base import ProviderType  # LINE 228\n```\n**Impact**: Reduces testability, creates circular dependencies, and risks crashes during server initialization or module restructuring. Complicates deployment in isolated environments.\n**Recommendation**: Implement dependency injection for client context and provider registry access. Create an abstraction layer through interfaces or service locators.\n**Effort vs. Benefit**: Medium effort; High benefit (improves modularity and testability).\n\n### 2. Dead Code from Unused Update Functionality\n**Insight**: 20% of the codebase implements GitHub version checking that's explicitly disabled in execution.\n**Evidence**: \n```python\ndef fetch_github_version() -> Optional[tuple[str, str]]:  # LINES 82-124\n# ... unused function ...\noutput_lines.append(\"Online update checks are disabled.\")  # LINE 220\n```\n**Impact**: Increases maintenance burden, confuses developers, and bloats the codebase with unreachable network operations.\n**Recommendation**: Remove `fetch_github_version()`, `parse_version()`, `compare_versions()`, and related urllib imports. If future updates are planned, implement as a separate tool.\n**Effort vs. Benefit**: Low effort; Medium benefit (reduces complexity by 20%).\n\n### 3. Overly Broad Exception Handling\n**Insight**: Generic exception catching masks specific failures and hinders debugging.\n**Evidence**: \n```python\nexcept Exception as e:  # LINE 122, 210, 261\n    logger.warning(f\"Error checking GitHub: {e}\")\n```\n**Impact**: Obscures root causes during failures, creates silent errors, and complicates troubleshooting in production.\n**Recommendation**: Replace broad `Exception` catches with specific exception types (HTTPError, URLError, ImportError). Add stack traces to debug logs.\n**Effort vs. Benefit**: Low effort; Medium benefit (improves operational visibility).\n\n### 4. Hardcoded External Dependencies\n**Insight**: Critical GitHub URL and provider type enumeration are embedded directly in code.\n**Evidence**: \n```python\ngithub_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main/config.py\"  # LINE 93\nprovider_types = [ProviderType.KIMI, ProviderType.GLM, ...]  # LINES 234-242\n```\n**Impact**: Creates deployment fragility, complicates environment-specific configurations, and risks breakage during repository restructuring.\n**Recommendation**: Externalize GitHub URL to configuration. Dynamically discover provider types from registry instead of hardcoding.\n**Effort vs. Benefit**: Low effort; Medium benefit (improves deployment flexibility).\n\n### 5. Inconsistent Error Visibility\n**Insight**: Critical failures are logged at different severity levels, creating inconsistent user feedback.\n**Evidence**: \n```python\nlogger.debug(f\"Could not get client info: {e}\")  # LINE 211 (debug)\nlogger.warning(f\"Error checking provider configuration: {e}\")  # LINE 262 (warning)\n```\n**Impact**: Users may miss important system state information, and debugging becomes inconsistent across failure modes.\n**Recommendation**: Standardize error reporting levels. Include error indicators in user-facing output (e.g., \"Client info: unavailable\").\n**Effort vs. Benefit**: Low effort; Low benefit (improves UX consistency).\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Remove unused update-checking functions (`fetch_github_version`, `parse_version`, `compare_versions`) and urllib imports\n- Replace broad `Exception` catches with specific exception types in network operations\n- Externalize GitHub URL to configuration file or environment variable\n- Standardize error logging levels across all exception handlers\n- Add error indicators to user output when client/provider info is unavailable\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1**: Decouple server dependencies through dependency injection\n2. **Phase 2**: Implement a system information service layer for reusable diagnostics\n3. **Phase 3**: Add configuration-driven provider discovery to eliminate hardcoded enumerations\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate Cleanup**: Remove dead update-checking code and urllib dependencies (1-2 hours)\n2. **Error Handling Refactor**: Implement specific exception handling with consistent logging (2-3 hours)\n3. **Dependency Decoupling**: Design and implement abstraction layer for server/provider access (1-2 days)\n\nThe tool shows strong architectural foundations but requires focused refactoring to eliminate coupling risks and technical debt. Prioritize dead code removal and error handling improvements for immediate operational benefits, followed by systematic decoupling to enhance long-term maintainability.",
