    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe version tool is a lightweight, read-only utility that cleanly surfaces build and runtime metadata.  \nIts architecture is sound—no external model calls, minimal I/O, and graceful degradation when offline.  \nHowever, it embeds three systemic liabilities: (1) hard-wired GitHub URL that will break on repo rename or fork, (2) runtime import side-effects that couple the tool to the running server singleton, and (3) provider-configuration enumeration that duplicates logic already owned by the registry. These issues are low-risk today but become blockers when the project scales to multiple distributions, containers, or private deployments.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Brittle Update-Check Endpoint\n**Insight:** Line 93 hard-codes “BeehiveInnovations/zen-mcp-server”; any repo move, fork, or enterprise mirror invalidates the check and logs a warning that users cannot suppress.  \n**Evidence:**  \n```python\ngithub_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BeehiveInnovations/zen-mcp-server/main/config.py\"\n```  \n**Impact:** Silent feature loss in forks; support burden increases when users see perpetual “check failed” messages.  \n**Recommendation:** Move URL to `config.py` or an env var with a fallback “disable” flag; inject via DI in `__init__`.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High\n\n### 2. Tight Runtime Coupling to Server Singleton\n**Insight:** Lines 203-206 import the live `server` module at runtime to extract client context, assuming the process is an MCP server and not a CLI or test runner.  \n**Evidence:**  \n```python\nimport server as server_module\nclient_info = get_client_info_from_context(server_module.server)\n```  \n**Impact:** Prevents reuse of the tool in offline scripts, unit tests, or future headless distributions; import may raise `AttributeError` or circular imports as the codebase grows.  \n**Recommendation:** Accept an optional `context` parameter in `execute` and let the caller inject client metadata; keep the tool pure.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High\n\n### 3. Duplicate Provider-Introspection Logic\n**Insight:** Lines 227-263 re-implement provider enumeration and status formatting that the `ModelProviderRegistry` already exposes.  \n**Evidence:** Local lists `provider_types`/`provider_names` must be kept in sync with registry additions.  \n**Impact:** Double source of truth; missing or reordered entries produce misleading “not configured” messages.  \n**Recommendation:** Add `registry.get_provider_summary()` returning a list of `(name, configured)` tuples; let the tool simply iterate and render.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 4. Version Parsing Reinvents Packaging Standards\n**Insight:** Lines 34-55 implement custom tuple parsing instead of using `packaging.version.Version`, which handles pre-releases, local segments, and edge cases.  \n**Impact:** Future versions like “1.2.3b1” or “1.2.3+gpu” will mis-compare; silent logic bug.  \n**Recommendation:** Replace `parse_version` with `packaging.version.parse`; drop bespoke code.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 5. Silent Failure on Missing urllib\n**Insight:** Lines 16-22 set `HAS_URLLIB = False` if import fails, but urllib is part of CPython stdlib since 2.x; the guard is unnecessary and signals an environment that is effectively unsupported.  \n**Impact:** Code clutter; future readers waste time wondering when urllib could be absent.  \n**Recommendation:** Remove the conditional import and the flag; let the import raise if the runtime is truly broken.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Low\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Replace `parse_version` with `packaging.version.parse` (one-line change).  \n- Extract GitHub URL to `config.GITHUB_RAW_URL` with env override.  \n- Delete `HAS_URLLIB` branch and associated log noise.  \n- Add unit test that calls `VersionTool.execute({})` in isolation to prove no import side-effects.\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n- Introduce a `SystemInfoPort` interface so tools can receive host metadata (client, paths, feature flags) without importing the server.  \n- Centralise all “distribution” metadata (repo URL, docs URL, issue tracker) in a single `DistributionManifest` loaded at start-up; tools read from there.  \n- Adopt a plugin-style tool loader so version, health, and similar utilities are registered declaratively and remain side-effect free.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Open PR that externalises the GitHub URL and removes the urllib guard—low risk, immediate payoff.  \n2. Add isolated unit test coverage for `VersionTool.execute`; enforce no server import in CI.  \n3.",

You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement.
