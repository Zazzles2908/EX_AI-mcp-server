    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe `AnalyzeTool` implements a sophisticated step-by-step code analysis workflow with strong architectural foundations but exhibits critical flaws in error handling, security practices, and UX complexity. Key strengths include structured investigation phases and comprehensive validation, while risks center on subprocess vulnerabilities, unimplemented methods, and overly verbose user guidance.\n\n## Strategic Findings\n\n### 1. CRITICAL: Unimplemented Method in Core Workflow\n**Insight:** The `_build_analysis_summary` method (line 459) lacks implementation but is called in `prepare_work_summary` (line 660), causing runtime failures.\n**Evidence:**  \n```python\ndef _build_analysis_summary(self, consolidated_findings) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Prepare a comprehensive summary of the analysis investigation.\"\"\"\n    # No implementation - only docstring\n```\n**Impact:** Tool crashes during final analysis consolidation, breaking the entire workflow.\n**Recommendation:** Implement the method or remove the call in `prepare_work_summary`.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff (prevents workflow crashes).\n\n### 2. SECURITY VULNERABILITY: Subprocess Shell Injection Risk\n**Insight:** Git command execution uses `shell=True` (line 171) with unescaped paths, creating command injection risks.\n**Evidence:**  \n```python\ncmd = \"git -c core.quotepath=false status --porcelain\"\nproc = subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True, cwd=os.getcwd())\n```\n**Impact:** Malicious file paths could execute arbitrary commands.\n**Recommendation:** Replace with `subprocess.run([\"git\", ...], ...)` and sanitize paths.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, Critical payoff (security hardening).\n\n### 3. UX COMPLEXITY: Overwhelming Step Guidance\n**Insight:** Step guidance messages (lines 711-736) are excessively verbose, increasing cognitive load.\n**Evidence:**  \n```python\nnext_steps = (\n    f\"MANDATORY: DO NOT call the {self.get_name()} tool again immediately. You MUST first examine...\"\n    # 200+ character warning repeated for each step\n)\n```\n**Impact:** Users struggle to extract actionable instructions, reducing tool adoption.\n**Recommendation:** Condense messages to 3-5 bullet points with clear action verbs.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff (improves usability).\n\n### 4. INEFFICIENCY: Redundant Expert Analysis Calls\n**Insight:** Expert analysis always runs (line 616) even for empty inputs, wasting resources.\n**Evidence:**  \n```python\ndef should_skip_expert_analysis(self, request, consolidated_findings) -> bool:\n    return False  # Always runs expert analysis\n```\n**Impact:** Unnecessary API calls and latency for trivial analyses.\n**Recommendation:** Skip expert analysis when `relevant_files` is empty or `findings` is minimal.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff (optimizes performance).\n\n### 5. TECH DEBT: Fragile Fallback Logic\n**Insight:** Git fallback defaults to analyzing entire repo root (line 185) when commands fail.\n**Evidence:**  \n```python\nexcept Exception:\n    self.relevant_files = [\".\"]  # Analyzes entire repo\n```\n**Impact:** Can cause timeouts or resource exhaustion in large codebases.\n**Recommendation:** Fail fast with actionable error messages instead of risky defaults.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff (prevents resource exhaustion).\n\n## Quick Wins\n1. Fix `_build_analysis_summary` implementation to prevent crashes\n2. Replace `shell=True` with argument-based subprocess calls\n3. Add input validation for `total_steps` (ensure ≥1)\n4. Reduce step guidance message length by 50%\n5. Add early exit for empty `relevant_files` in expert analysis\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1:** Implement caching for git operations and agentic engine decisions\n2. **Phase 2:** Refactor `prepare_step_data` into smaller, focused methods\n3. **Phase 3:** Add analysis templates for common scenarios (security, performance)\n4. **Phase 4:** Integrate with observability tools for workflow metrics\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate:** Fix the unimplemented `_build_analysis_summary` method to prevent workflow crashes\n2. **Security Hardening:** Replace all `shell=True` subprocess calls with argument-based execution\n3. **UX Optimization:** Condense step guidance messages and add input validation for `total_steps`",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
