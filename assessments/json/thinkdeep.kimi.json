    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview  \nThe ThinkDeep tool is a well-intentioned “deep-reasoning” orchestrator that tries to guide an LLM through a multi-step, confidence-driven investigation and then optionally submits the result to a second, “expert” model for validation.  Architecturally it is a single-file, inheritance-heavy workflow plug-in (≈ 730 LOC) that sits on top of an unseen base framework.  While the surface API is clean, the implementation is already showing systemic strain: duplicated logic, hidden state coupling, hard-coded thresholds, and a growing tangle of confidence strings, magic numbers, and environment toggles.  At current scale these flaws are tolerable, but any increase in usage or team size will turn the module into a maintenance bottleneck and a UX land-mine (silent timeouts, mysterious skips, non-deterministic expert calls).  The good news: the problems are fixable without a re-write—mainly by collapsing redundant code paths, externalising configuration, and introducing explicit state machines.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Hidden Control-Flow & Non-Deterministic Expert Invocation  \n**Insight:** Whether the “expert” model runs is decided by three independent, poorly-coordinated gates (`should_call_expert_analysis`, `should_skip_expert_analysis`, `get_request_use_assistant_model`) that inspect overlapping flags (`confidence`, `next_step_required`, env-vars, heuristic counts).  \n**Evidence:**  \n- `should_call_expert_analysis` (l. 555-586) returns `True` if `next_step_required == False`, but `should_skip_expert_analysis` (l. 312-316) immediately returns `True` when `confidence == \"certain\"`, creating a race that depends on call order.  \n- `get_request_use_assistant_model` (l. 424-479) adds a 7-variable heuristic that is invisible to the caller and can silently flip the outcome when a single line of findings text changes.  \n**Impact:** Users will see intermittent “expert” answers for identical prompts; tests become flaky; prod behaviour drifts without code changes.  \n**Recommendation:** Replace the trio with a single, deterministic policy object that is unit-tested and documented. Expose a `reason` field in the response so the UI can always explain why expert analysis was skipped or run.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High  \n\n### 2. Confidence Taxonomy Over-Engineered & Stringly-Typed  \n**Insight:** Nine English confidence levels (`exploring` → `certain`) are compared via string equality throughout the codebase; no enum or validation exists.  \n**Evidence:** `confidence == \"certain\"` used in at least six places (l. 300, 312, 369, 474, 569, 629). A typo (`\"certain \"` with trailing space) would silently break the skip logic.  \n**Impact:** Fat-finger bugs bypass expert validation; downstream services cannot parse the scalar reliably.  \n**Recommendation:** Introduce a `ConfidenceLevel` IntEnum (`EXPLORING=1 … CERTAIN=8`) and a single helper `confidence >= ConfidenceLevel.HIGH`. Serialize to string only at the API boundary.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High  \n\n### 3. Magic Numbers & Hard-Coded Thresholds  \n**Insight:** Time-outs, heartbeat intervals, and heuristic cut-offs are buried as string literals inside `os.getenv` calls.  \n**Evidence:**  \n- `THINKDEEP_EXPERT_TIMEOUT_SECS` defaults to `25` (l. 229) – too short for large codebases, too long for CLI users.  \n- `len(findings_text) >= 200` (l. 475) decides richness; no evidence this correlates with quality.  \n**Impact:** Ops cannot tune without code deploy; users hit silent 25-s hangs or premature cut-offs.  \n**Recommendation:** Move all constants to a typed `ThinkDeepConfig` dataclass loaded once at start-up; allow live override via env or config file; emit a “limits” block in every response so callers know the boundaries.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium  \n\n### 4. Duplicated & Dead Code  \n**Insight:** Identical methods and stray return statements inflate the file and confuse readers.  \n**Evidence:**  \n- `get_default_thinking_mode` (l. 218-221) ends with an unreachable `return` (l. 244) after the correct return.  \n- `customize_workflow_response` stores `temperature/thinking_mode/use_websearch` (l. 254-269) but the same extraction is repeated in `get_request_temperature` et al.  \n**Impact:** Cognitive load, larger binary, future changes miss one of the copies.  \n**Recommendation:** Run `vulture`/`pylint`; enable `mypy --warn-unreachable`; consolidate parameter",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
