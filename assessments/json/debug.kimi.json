    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe debug tool is a well-intentioned attempt to formalise root-cause analysis, but it is over-engineered, state-heavy, and user-hostile.  \nIt couples a rigid multi-step workflow to a mountain of configuration, embeds business logic in string dictionaries, and forces synchronous human-in-the-loop pauses that break automation pipelines.  \nThe codebase will be hard to extend, painful to test, and will frustrate both CLI users and API consumers.  \nImmediate simplification (stateless prompts, optional steps, idempotent calls) is medium effort and yields high payoff; failure to do so will turn the tool into a maintenance anchor.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Over-Engineered Workflow State Machine\n**Insight:** 150+ lines of field descriptors, step mappings, and confidence enums create a pseudo-protocol that duplicates what a simple prompt template could achieve.  \n**Evidence:** `DEBUG_INVESTIGATION_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS` (lines 35-114) and `get_step_guidance` (lines 427-487) encode procedural instructions in giant strings.  \n**Impact:** Every new investigation type requires touching three files (schema, guidance, descriptions) → exponential growth in tech debt.  \n**Recommendation:** Collapse to a single prompt template with optional “hints” parameter; let the LLM drive the conversation instead of the code.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium / High\n\n### 2. Hidden Synchronous Human Bottleneck\n**Insight:** `get_required_actions` returns human tasks (“Search for code…”, “Examine relevant files…”) and the tool **blocks** until the user claims they did them.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 281-320 list human-only actions; no parallel or automated fallback exists.  \n**Impact:** Breaks CI/CD, chatbots, and any headless usage; forces a human click-through for every step.  \n**Recommendation:** Introduce an `auto_investigate` flag that lets the caller supply pre-collected evidence (files, logs, traces) and skip human pauses.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High\n\n### 3. Brittle String-Based Confidence Protocol\n**Insight:** Seven-level confidence enum (`exploring` → `certain`) is compared via string equality throughout the code; no validation, no typing, no migration path.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 98-105, 252-254, 328, 552, etc.  \n**Impact:** A typo or rename breaks control flow silently; impossible to unit-test exhaustively.  \n**Recommendation:** Replace with `IntEnum` or keep only three levels (`low`, `medium`, `high`) and derive the rest from presence of evidence.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 4. Secret Security Validation Layer\n**Insight:** Optional `SECURE_INPUTS_ENFORCED` flag (lines 496-532) normalises file paths and validates images, but failure raises a generic `ValueError` that leaks no context.  \n**Evidence:** `except Exception as e: raise ValueError(f\"[debug:security] {e}\")` (line 532).  \n**Impact:** Hard to diagnose why legitimate files are rejected; couples security policy to a single tool instead of central middleware.  \n**Recommendation:** Move validation to a Pydantic validator on the request model; return structured errors (`ValidationError`) that tooling can catch.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 5. Monolithic Response Mapping\n**Insight:** `customize_workflow_response` (lines 646-684) renames generic workflow keys to debug-specific ones, creating a shadow schema that must stay in sync with the base class.  \n**Evidence:** Dictionary remapping `f\"{tool_name}_status\"` → `\"investigation_status\"`, etc.  \n**Impact:** Double source of truth; renaming the base class key silently breaks the API surface.  \n**Recommendation:** Use a single schema with optional `debug` namespace; drop the remapping entirely.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n---\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Replace giant string descriptions with a Markdown prompt template stored in `systemprompts.py`; delete `DEBUG_INVESTIGATION_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS`.  \n- Add `auto_investigate: bool = False` to `DebugInvestigationRequest`; when `True`, skip `get_required_actions` human checks.  \n- Convert confidence to `IntEnum` and expose a `confidence_value` property for ordering.  \n- Move `SecureInputValidator` call into a Pydantic root-validator; raise `RequestValidationError` instead of `ValueError`.  \n- Delete `customize_workflow_response`; rename base workflow keys once, globally.\n\n---\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Make the tool stateless:** Store conversation history in the chat thread, not in the tool instance (`self.initial_issue`, `self.consolidated_find",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
