Blocking I/O in Async Server Loop\\n**Insight:** `read_tail_with_rotation` (lines 151-189) performs potentially large file reads synchronously, blocking the main event loop for the duration of disk I/O.  \\n**Evidence:** `base_path.open(...).readlines()` is called directly inside `execute` (line 183) with no `await`.  \\n**Impact:** Under concurrent requests or multi-MB logs the server becomes unresponsive; tail latency spikes.  \\n**Recommendation:** Off-load file reading to a thread-pool (`asyncio.to_thread`) or pre-index logs in a background task.  \\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort (wrap I/O in `to_thread`); High payoff (removes primary scalability ceiling).\\n\\n### 2. Silent Feature Discoverability / UX Debt\\n**Insight:** Fields `since`, `until`, `structured` are declared in the schema (lines 63-75) but silently ignored unless env-vars are set (lines 198, 236).  \\n**Evidence:** Client sees parameters in introspection yet receives no hint that they are disabled; user files “bug” reports.  \\n**Impact:** Support overhead, degraded trust in tool contracts.  \\n**Recommendation:** Either (a) remove schema entries until features ship, or (b) return a warning header when gated params are supplied but disabled.  \\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (avails confusion now, cheaper than documentation).\\n\\n### 3. Missing Operational Telemetry\\n**Insight:** All failure paths return a plain `TextContent` string; no metrics, logs, or tracing emitted.  \\n**Evidence:** Lines 100, 138, 141, 195, 233 return `[activity:error] ...` only to the caller.  \\n**Impact:** Ops team blind to how often the tool fails, which regexes crash, or how long reads take.  \\n**Recommendation:** Emit structured diagnostic events (e.g., OpenTelemetry span with `exception` event) before returning error to user.  \\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort (instrument once, reuse across tools); High long-term payoff.\\n\\n### 4. Overly Permissive Path Traversal when Overrides Used\\n**Insight:** When env-vars `EX_*_LOG_PATH` are set, the tool allows any absolute path (line 136-138) but only checks traversal for default paths.  \\n**Evidence:** `_expand` resolves symlinks and env-vars; no further validation after override.  \\n**Impact:** A compromised client or CI job could point the tool at `/etc/passwd` or large binary files, causing data leak or DoS.  \\n**Recommendation:** After override resolution, ensure the final path is still within an allow-list (e.g., server’s configured log-dir).  \\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; High payoff (closes security boundary).\\n\\n### 5. Regex DoS Surface\\n**Insight:** User-supplied `filter` regex is compiled without timeout or complexity check (line 230).  \\n**Evidence:** `re.compile(req.filter)` – Python’s default engine is back-tracking.  \\n**Impact:** A single malicious pattern (e.g., `(a+)+$`) stalls the event loop for seconds-to-minutes.  \\n**Recommendation:** Use `regex` module with `timeout=0.1s` or move filtering to a subprocess with resource limits.  \\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low-Medium effort; Medium payoff (defends against adversarial input).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Quick Wins\\n- Wrap file I/O in `asyncio.to_thread` (line 183) – one-line change, immediate scalability gain.  \\n- Add `logger.warning` or OTel event when gated parameters are ignored – improves supportability.  \\n- Clamp `lines` upper bound to 1 000 in schema (line 48) – prevents accidental 5 000-line megapayloads.  \\n- Return HTTP-style `Warning` header in `TextContent` when regex fails – keeps protocol yet informs user.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\\n1. **Log-Indexing Service**  \\n   Introduce a tiny in-process SQLite or keyed-queue that tails logs once and serves indexed queries (`since`/`until`) in O(log n) instead of O(n) full scans\", \"parse_info\": \"Response in Markdown format (expected for this tool)\"}, \"next_steps\": \"ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE.
