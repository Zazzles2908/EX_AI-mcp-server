    "raw_analysis": "\n## Executive Overview\nThe `kimi_chat_with_tools` implementation demonstrates sophisticated orchestration of AI chat with tool integration, but suffers from high complexity, tight coupling, and architectural fragility. Key risks include monolithic `execute` method, brittle error handling, and streaming/tool-call limitations that hinder scalability and maintainability. Strengths include flexible tool normalization and multi-backend web search support.\n\n## Strategic Findings\n\n### 1. Monolithic Execute Method Hinders Maintainability\n**Insight:** The 300+ line `execute` method violates single responsibility principle, making the tool fragile and hard to test.\n**Evidence:** Lines 68-407 contain intertwined provider setup, tool normalization, message handling, streaming logic, and tool execution.\n**Impact:** Changes risk cascading failures; new features require deep understanding of entire method.\n**Recommendation:** Decompose into focused methods: `_setup_provider()`, `_normalize_inputs()`, `_handle_streaming()`, `_execute_tool_loop()`, `_run_web_search()`.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (improves testability, reduces cognitive load).\n\n### 2. Brittle Error Handling Obscures Failures\n**Insight:** Silent exception swallowing (lines 93-94, 148-150, 210-211) hides critical errors and complicates debugging.\n**Evidence:** Multiple bare `except: pass` blocks mask configuration issues and network failures.\n**Impact:** Runtime failures become invisible; operational blind spots increase system instability.\n**Recommendation:** Replace silent catches with structured logging and error propagation. Use `logging.error()` with context.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; High payoff (improves observability and debugging).\n\n### 3. Streaming/Tool-Call Incompatibility Limits UX\n**Insight:** Streaming mode disables tool execution (lines 184-185), breaking expected tool workflows.\n**Evidence:** `if use_websearch: stream_flag = False` forces fallback to non-streaming for tool calls.\n**Impact:** Inconsistent behavior; users can't get real-time responses with tool execution.\n**Recommendation:** Implement hybrid streaming: buffer responses until tool calls detected, then switch to non-streaming for tool execution.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort; Medium payoff (improves UX consistency).\n\n### 4. Tight Coupling with Web Search Backend\n**Insight:** Hardcoded web search logic (lines 265-310) violates separation of concerns.\n**Evidence:** 45 lines of HTTP request handling embedded in core tool logic.\n**Impact:** Adding new search backends requires modifying core tool; increases test surface.\n**Recommendation:** Extract web search into `WebSearchService` with pluggable backends.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (improves modularity and extensibility).\n\n### 5. Configuration Sprawl Increases Cognitive Load\n**Insight:** 7+ environment variables create configuration complexity without clear governance.\n**Evidence:** Lines 29, 136-138, 267, 270, 284, 330-332, 335-334.\n**Impact:** Onboarding friction; deployment fragility; unclear configuration precedence.\n**Recommendation:** Centralize configuration in a `ToolConfig` class with validation and defaults.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (improves deployment reliability).\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Fix logging undefined variables (lines 88-91) by moving logging after variable definitions\n- Add input validation for `messages` schema (currently only checks `type: array`)\n- Replace `urllib` with `httpx` for async web search support\n- Document environment variables in `get_description()` for transparency\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1:** Refactor `execute` method and extract web search service\n2. **Phase 2:** Implement hybrid streaming with tool-call support\n3. **Phase 3:** Add tool execution timeout management and circuit breakers\n4. **Phase 4:** Integrate observability metrics for tool usage and latency\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate:** Refactor `execute` method into focused components (1-2 days)\n2. **Short-term:** Extract web search service and add configuration validation (1 week)\n3. **Medium-term:** Design hybrid streaming prototype (2 weeks)",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
