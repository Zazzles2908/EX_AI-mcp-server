    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe `provider_capabilities` tool is a lightweight diagnostic utility that safely surfaces provider configuration and tool availability. While functionally sound for its current scope, it exhibits several architectural red flags: ad-hoc caching, tight coupling to environment variables, and a brittle tool-discovery mechanism that will become problematic as the MCP server grows. The implementation prioritizes immediate convenience over long-term maintainability and operational robustness.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Cache Implementation Anti-Pattern\n**Insight:** The 90-second TTL cache (lines 55-66) uses global state and exception-swallowing, creating race conditions and testability issues.\n**Evidence:** \n```python\nglobal _PCAP_CACHE\nif invalidate_cache:\n    _PCAP_CACHE = None\nif '_PCAP_CACHE' not in globals():\n    _PCAP_CACHE = {}\nexcept Exception:\n    _PCAP_CACHE = {}\n```\n**Impact:** Concurrent executions may corrupt cache state; unit tests become flaky; cache invalidation is unreliable in async contexts.\n**Recommendation:** Replace with an injected cache strategy (Redis/in-memory dict via constructor) or remove caching entirely—env reads are cheap.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff (eliminates hidden bugs)\n\n### 2. Environment Variable Hard-Coding\n**Insight:** Provider-specific env vars are scattered throughout the code (lines 73-84), creating a maintenance nightmare when adding new providers.\n**Evidence:** Direct references to KIMI_*, GLM_* variables without abstraction.\n**Impact:** Adding a new provider requires touching this file, violating Open/Closed principle; high risk of drift between documentation and implementation.\n**Recommendation:** Introduce a `ProviderConfig` dataclass that centralizes env var mapping and validation.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff (scales cleanly)\n\n### 3. Tool Discovery Coupling\n**Insight:** ToolRegistry is imported and instantiated inline (lines 89-92), creating a hidden dependency and making the tool untestable in isolation.\n**Evidence:** \n```python\nfrom tools.registry import ToolRegistry, TOOL_VISIBILITY\n_reg = ToolRegistry()\n_reg.build_tools()\n```\n**Impact:** Cannot mock registry for testing; circular import risk if registry depends on this tool; startup performance hit from repeated tool building.\n**Recommendation:** Inject ToolRegistry instance via constructor or use a singleton registry that's initialized once at server startup.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, Medium payoff\n\n### 4. UX Complexity via Hidden Parameters\n**Insight:** The `show_advanced` flag (line 25) changes behavior without clear user guidance, creating discoverability issues.\n**Evidence:** No help text or schema description explains what \"advanced\" means; visibility logic is buried in TOOL_VISIBILITY mapping.\n**Impact:** Users won't know advanced tools exist; inconsistent behavior across environments.\n**Recommendation:** Add schema descriptions and consider splitting into two distinct tools: `list_core_tools` and `list_all_tools`.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff\n\n### 5. Silent Failure Modes\n**Insight:** Both tool discovery (line 100) and cache initialization (line 64) swallow exceptions silently, masking configuration problems.\n**Evidence:** Bare `except Exception: pass` patterns.\n**Impact:** Production issues go undetected; debugging becomes archaeology.\n**Recommendation:** Log warnings at minimum, or propagate specific exceptions with context.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Replace bare exception handlers with `logger.warning()` calls\n- Add schema descriptions for all input parameters\n- Extract env var list to a constant at module top\n- Remove caching entirely (premature optimization)\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Provider Abstraction Layer**: Create a `Provider` interface with implementations per provider (KimiProvider, GlmProvider) that encapsulate env vars, endpoints, and capabilities.\n2. **Configuration Schema**: Move from env vars to a typed configuration file with validation (Pydantic models).\n3. **Health Check Integration**: Merge this tool's functionality into a comprehensive `/health` endpoint that includes provider connectivity tests.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate**: Remove the cache implementation and add proper logging for all failure paths\n2. **Short-term**: Refactor env var access into a centralized configuration module\n3. **Medium-term**: Redesign tool discovery to use dependency injection pattern",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
