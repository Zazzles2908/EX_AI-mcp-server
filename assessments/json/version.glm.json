    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe version tool provides essential server and system information but exhibits architectural misalignment through fragile dynamic imports, dead code, and hardcoded provider configurations. While functional, its design introduces stability risks and maintenance overhead that contradict long-term scalability goals. The tool's core logic is sound, but its execution strategy undermines reliability and future extensibility.\n\n## Strategic Findings\n\n### 1. Fragile Dynamic Imports Create Instability\n**Insight:** Direct imports of `server` and `utils.client_info` within the execution method create brittleness and violate dependency inversion.\n**Evidence:** Lines 203-206:\n```python\nimport server as server_module\nfrom utils.client_info import format_client_info, get_client_info_from_context\nclient_info = get_client_info_from_context(server_module.server)\n```\n**Impact:** Changes to module structure or missing dependencies cause silent failures, reducing diagnostic reliability and increasing debugging complexity.\n**Recommendation:** Refactor to use dependency injection—pass server instance during tool initialization.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (improves testability and stability).\n\n### 2. Dead Code Contradicts Documentation\n**Insight:** `fetch_github_version()` exists but is explicitly disabled in output, creating confusion and technical debt.\n**Evidence:** Lines 82-124 (unused function) vs. Lines 218-221 (\"Online update checks are disabled\").\n**Impact:** Wasted maintenance effort and inconsistent tool behavior.\n**Recommendation:** Remove `fetch_github_version()` and related urllib imports (lines 16-22, 82-124).\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (reduces codebase complexity).\n\n### 3. Hardcoded Provider Configuration Limits Extensibility\n**Insight:** Provider types/names are hardcoded, requiring manual updates when new providers are added.\n**Evidence:** Lines 234-244:\n```python\nprovider_types = [ProviderType.KIMI, ProviderType.GLM, ...]\nprovider_names = [\"Moonshot Kimi\", \"ZhipuAI GLM\", ...]\n```\n**Impact:** New provider additions require code changes in multiple places, increasing error risk and slowing development.\n**Recommendation:** Auto-populate providers from `ModelProviderRegistry` metadata.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (future-proofs configuration).\n\n### 4. Inefficient Provider Status Checks\n**Insight:** Provider status checks iterate through all types sequentially without caching, risking performance degradation.\n**Evidence:** Lines 246-249: Loop over all provider types for status checks.\n**Impact:** Slow execution with many providers; redundant calls to `ModelProviderRegistry`.\n**Recommendation:** Cache provider status or batch-check during server startup.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; Medium payoff (improves response time).\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Remove unused `fetch_github_version()` function and urllib imports.\n- Replace hardcoded provider lists with dynamic registry lookups.\n- Add specific exception handling for provider checks (replace broad `except Exception`).\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1:** Refactor dependency injection for server/client info access.\n2. **Phase 2:** Implement provider status caching and lazy-loading.\n3. **Phase 3:** Extract provider configuration to a dedicated config module.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate:** Remove dead code (`fetch_github_version`) and hardcoded provider lists.\n2. **Short-term:** Refactor dynamic imports to use dependency injection.\n3. **Medium-term:** Introduce provider status caching to improve performance.",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
