    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe version tool is a lightweight, read-only utility that surfaces server metadata and provider health.  \nIt is architecturally sound for its narrow purpose, but the update-check path is disabled yet still shipped, the GitHub fetcher is brittle, and the tool quietly swallows all errors—creating silent-failure UX risk.  \nStrengths: zero external dependencies for core output, clear separation of concerns, and no blocking I/O in the hot path.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Dead-Code Update Checker\n**Insight:** `fetch_github_version()` and `compare_versions()` are fully implemented but never called; the UI claims “Online update checks are disabled” (line 220).  \n**Evidence:** Lines 82-125 contain network, regex, and version-comparison logic that is imported and unit-testable yet unreachable.  \n**Impact:** Increases attack surface (regex on untrusted HTTP body), binary size, and future maintenance burden for a feature that is intentionally off.  \n**Recommendation:** Either delete the code or gate it behind an opt-in flag (`--check-updates`) so the path is exercised and tested.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / High\n\n### 2. Silent Failure Pattern\n**Insight:** Every helper (`get_client_info_from_context`, provider registry, model count) is wrapped in a bare `except Exception` that logs at debug/warning level but continues.  \n**Evidence:** Lines 210-211, 261-263.  \n**Impact:** Users see stale or partial data with no indication that something went wrong; hard to debug in production.  \n**Recommendation:** Adopt a “fail-fast-for-metadata” strategy: if a non-critical subsection fails, append “⚠️  partial data” to the header and surface the exception message in the output (or at least log at ERROR level).  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 3. Hard-Coded GitHub URL & Regex Coupling\n**Insight:** The update fetcher points to a raw GitHub URL and parses `__version__` with a naive regex.  \n**Evidence:** Line 93 URL and lines 105-106 regex.  \n**Impact:** Repository rename, branch rename, or simple re-formatting of `config.py` breaks the regex; the failure is silent.  \n**Recommendation:** If the update checker is kept, move URL and regex to configuration and add a contract test that asserts the regex against the current `config.py`.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 4. Import-Time Side Effect Risk\n**Insight:** `import server as server_module` (line 203) inside `execute()` can trigger full server initialisation at tool-call time if not already imported.  \n**Evidence:** Line 203 dynamic import inside async method.  \n**Impact:** First call to `version` may block the event loop or duplicate singleton initialisation.  \n**Recommendation:** Inject the server instance via constructor or context instead of late import; or guard with `if 'server' not in sys.modules: …`.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Medium\n\n### 5. Over-Generic Input Schema\n**Insight:** The tool advertises an unused `\"model\"` parameter (line 152) that is immediately ignored.  \n**Evidence:** Schema declares `model` string, description says “ignored by version tool”.  \n**Impact:** Confuses consumers of the MCP schema and bloats auto-generated clients.  \n**Recommendation:** Remove the property; keep `properties` empty or add a real parameter such as `--format=json`.  \n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low / Low\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Delete unreachable `fetch_github_version()` / `compare_versions()` or enable via flag.  \n- Change all `logger.warning` inside `execute()` to `logger.error` so failures appear in default log levels.  \n- Replace dynamic `import server` with dependency injection.  \n- Drop the dummy `\"model\"` parameter from the JSON schema.\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n- Provide a machine-readable output mode (`--format json`) so CI pipelines can parse version and provider health.  \n- Expose a `/health` meta-tool that re-uses the provider-status logic but adds latency and auth checks.  \n- Centralise version parsing into a shared `packaging.version.Version` usage instead of custom tuple logic.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Decide fate of update checker (remove or feature-flag).  \n2. Harden error visibility by elevating log levels and surfacing partial-data warnings in the UI.  \n3. Refactor server access to use dependency injection, eliminating runtime import side effects.",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
