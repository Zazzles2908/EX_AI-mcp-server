    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe secaudit tool implements a comprehensive security audit workflow with systematic multi-step investigation, but exhibits significant architectural overengineering, excessive complexity in state management, and potential scalability bottlenecks. While its security-focused design is conceptually sound, the implementation introduces unnecessary UX friction and maintainability challenges that could undermine long-term adoption and reliability.\n\n## Strategic Findings\n\n### 1. Overengineered State Management Architecture\n**Insight:** The tool uses excessive instance variables and complex state tracking that creates maintenance overhead without proportional benefits.\n**Evidence:** Lines 211-212 (`self.initial_request`, `self.security_config`), 599-607 (config storage in `prepare_step_data`), and 731-743 (duplicate config storage in `customize_workflow_response`).\n**Impact:** Creates state synchronization risks, increases memory footprint, and complicates concurrent audit scenarios.\n**Recommendation:** Replace instance variables with a dedicated audit state object and implement immutable data patterns.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (reduces bugs, improves testability).\n\n### 2. Inefficient String Processing Pipeline\n**Insight:** Critical path methods use inefficient string concatenation for large context building, risking performance degradation during complex audits.\n**Evidence:** Lines 351-398 (`prepare_expert_analysis_context`) and 429-445 (`_build_security_audit_summary`) use repeated string joins.\n**Impact:** Will cause noticeable latency with large file sets or complex compliance frameworks, especially in CI/CD pipelines.\n**Recommendation:** Implement streaming context builders using `io.StringIO` or pre-allocated buffers.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (improves responsiveness).\n\n### 3. Brittle Validation Logic\n**Insight:** Input validation relies on external dependencies with opaque error handling, creating silent failures and security risks.\n**Evidence:** Lines 548-584 (exception swallowing in `prepare_step_data`) and 190-194 (compliance validation only logs warnings).\n**Impact:** Allows invalid inputs to propagate, potentially causing audit failures or security bypasses.\n**Recommendation:** Implement strict validation with explicit error types and fail-fast behavior.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (improves reliability and security posture).\n\n### 4. UX Complexity from Overprescriptive Workflow\n**Insight:** The tool enforces rigid step-by-step progression with verbose guidance, creating cognitive load and workflow friction.\n**Evidence:** Lines 687-725 (`get_security_audit_step_guidance`) produces 100+ character guidance messages.\n**Impact:** Increases onboarding time and discourages ad-hoc security checks, reducing tool adoption.\n**Recommendation:** Implement optional \"expert mode\" with streamlined progression and concise guidance.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; Medium payoff (improves user experience).\n\n### 5. Scalability Bottleneck in Context Building\n**Insight:** Expert analysis context building scales linearly with file count, risking timeouts with large codebases.\n**Evidence:** Lines 366-379 (file iteration in `prepare_expert_analysis_context`) and 400-427 (issue formatting).\n**Impact:** Will fail on monorepos or large enterprise systems, limiting tool applicability.\n**Recommendation:** Implement lazy loading with file chunking and priority-based context sampling.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort; High payoff (enables enterprise adoption).\n\n## Quick Wins\n1. **Replace string concatenation** with `io.StringIO` in context-building methods (Lines 351-398)\n2. **Consolidate duplicate config storage** between `prepare_step_data` and `customize_workflow_response` (Lines 599-607 vs 731-743)\n3. **Add explicit validation errors** for compliance requirements instead of warnings (Lines 190-194)\n4. **Reduce guidance verbosity** by 50% using bullet points and action verbs (Lines 687-725)\n5. **Implement file count limits** with clear error messages for large audits (Lines 366-379)\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1:** Refactor state management into immutable audit objects (3-4 weeks)\n2. **Phase 2:** Implement lazy context loading with priority sampling (4-6 weeks)\n3. **Phase 3:** Add audit templates for common scenarios (OWASP, compliance) (2-3 weeks)\n4. **Phase 4:** Develop concurrent audit support for CI/CD integration (5-7 weeks)\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate:** Prioritize string processing optimization (Quick Win #1) to address performance bottlenecks\n2. **Short-term:** Refactor state management architecture to eliminate synchronization risks\n3. **Strategic:** Develop a lightweight \"quick audit\" mode for initial adoption before full workflow deployment",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
