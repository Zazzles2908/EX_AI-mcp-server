    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe refactor tool implements a comprehensive step-by-step workflow for code refactoring analysis with strong integration into an AI system. However, it suffers from architectural complexity, performance inefficiencies, and potential stability issues due to its monolithic design, extensive string manipulation, and complex conditional logic. The tool's strength lies in its structured approach and expert analysis integration, but its maintainability and scalability are compromised by tight coupling and single responsibility principle violations.\n\n## Strategic Findings\n\n### 1. Monolithic Architecture Violates Single Responsibility Principle\n**Insight:** The `RefactorTool` class handles too many concerns including validation, workflow management, expert analysis coordination, and response formatting.\n**Evidence:** The class spans 737 lines with methods for disparate responsibilities like `prepare_step_data()`, `customize_workflow_response()`, and `get_required_actions()`.\n**Impact:** This makes the code difficult to maintain, test, and extend. Changes to one feature risk breaking unrelated functionality.\n**Recommendation:** Refactor into focused classes: `RefactorValidator`, `RefactorWorkflow`, `RefactorAnalyzer`, `RefactorExpert`, and `RefactorResponse`.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff - significantly improves maintainability and testability.\n\n### 2. Inefficient String Operations Impact Performance\n**Insight:** The tool performs extensive string concatenation and manipulation, particularly in context building and response formatting.\n**Evidence:** Lines 387-431, 435-449, and 638-676 contain multiple string joins and concatenations that could be optimized.\n**Impact:** Performance degradation with large codebases and increased memory usage.\n**Recommendation:** Replace string concatenation with f-strings or template engines, and implement context size limits.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff - improves performance and reduces memory footprint.\n\n### 3. Complex Workflow Logic Creates UX and Stability Risks\n**Insight:** The step progression logic uses complex nested conditionals that are difficult to follow and maintain.\n**Evidence:** Lines 319-361 and 630-676 contain intricate conditional logic for determining required actions and step guidance.\n**Impact:** Confusing user experience and potential for workflow errors or instability.\n**Recommendation:** Simplify using a state machine or strategy pattern, and provide clearer documentation of workflow states.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff - improves user experience and system stability.\n\n### 4. Optional Security Enforcement Creates Vulnerability\n**Insight:** Security validation is only performed when `SECURE_INPUTS_ENFORCED` is True, creating a potential security gap.\n**Evidence:** Lines 479-515 wrap security validation in a try-except block with a configuration check.\n**Impact:** System could be vulnerable to malicious input if configuration is not properly set.\n**Recommendation:** Always enforce security validation with specific exception handling and input sanitization.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff - significantly improves security posture.\n\n### 5. No Caching Strategy Leads to Redundant Processing\n**Insight:** The tool repeatedly processes the same files and builds similar contexts without caching.\n**Evidence:** No caching mechanisms are visible in the code, and methods like `prepare_expert_analysis_context()` are called multiple times.\n**Impact:** Performance degradation and unnecessary resource consumption.\n**Recommendation:** Implement caching for file analysis results and frequently used context templates.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, Medium payoff - improves performance and reduces resource usage.\n\n## Quick Wins\n1. Replace string concatenation with f-strings in lines 387-431, 435-449, and 638-676\n2. Add specific exception handling in the security validation block (lines 479-515)\n3. Implement context size limits in `prepare_expert_analysis_context()` (lines 384-431)\n4. Add logging for workflow steps to improve debugging and monitoring\n5. Simplify conditional logic in `get_required_actions()` by using a lookup table\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1:** Refactor the monolithic `RefactorTool` class into focused components\n2. **Phase 2:** Implement comprehensive caching strategy and performance optimizations\n3. **Phase 3:** Add monitoring and metrics collection for operational insights\n4. **Phase 4:** Consider microservice architecture if the tool becomes more widely used\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate:** Address the most critical architectural issues by breaking down the `RefactorTool` class\n2. **Short-term:** Implement caching and optimize string operations for performance\n3. **Medium-term:** Enhance security enforcement and add comprehensive error handling",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
