    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe pre-commit validation tool presents a well-intentioned but overly complex workflow that risks creating significant friction in developer workflows. While it demonstrates strong architectural patterns (inheritance, validation, security), the implementation suffers from excessive configuration, convoluted state management, and UX complexity that could undermine adoption. The tool's strength lies in its comprehensive validation approach, but its weakness is the potential for analysis paralysis and developer fatigue.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. **Overengineered State Management**\n**Insight:** The tool maintains multiple overlapping state representations across different abstraction layers, creating cognitive overhead and potential synchronization issues.\n**Evidence:** Lines 195-197 show `initial_request` and `git_config` stored as instance variables, while lines 525-537 create a separate `step_data` dict. Additionally, lines 695-705 duplicate git configuration storage.\n**Impact:** This creates debugging complexity and potential state drift between workflow steps, making the tool harder to maintain and extend.\n**Recommendation:** Consolidate state into a single, immutable data structure passed between steps rather than maintaining multiple state representations.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff\n\n### 2. **Excessive Configuration Complexity**\n**Insight:** The tool exposes 15+ configuration parameters with intricate interdependencies, creating a steep learning curve and high error rate.\n**Evidence:** Lines 35-122 define extensive field descriptions, while lines 302-329 expose all parameters in the schema. The validation logic at lines 175-180 only scratches the surface of parameter validation.\n**Impact:** Developers will struggle to understand which parameters are required vs optional, leading to misconfiguration and abandoned usage.\n**Recommendation:** Implement a tiered configuration approach: essential (path only), standard (common options), and advanced (full feature set).\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff\n\n### 3. **Convoluted Confidence System**\n**Insight:** The 7-level confidence system (\"exploring\" to \"certain\") creates unnecessary complexity and unclear decision boundaries.\n**Evidence:** Lines 92-101 define the confidence levels with special handling for \"certain\", while lines 539-543 implement skip logic based on confidence. The guidance system (lines 633-688) branches heavily on confidence levels.\n**Impact:** This creates inconsistent behavior where the same investigation might trigger or skip expert analysis based on subjective confidence assessments.\n**Recommendation:** Simplify to 3 levels: investigating, validated, certain. Remove the \"certain\" bypass entirely to ensure consistent expert review.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff\n\n### 4. **Inefficient File Processing**\n**Insight:** The tool processes files multiple times through different validation layers without caching, creating performance bottlenecks.\n**Evidence:** Lines 486-523 show security validation happening on every step, while lines 695-705 re-process git configuration. No caching mechanism exists for repeated file access.\n**Impact:** Large repositories will experience significant slowdowns, making the tool impractical for daily use.\n**Recommendation:** Implement a caching layer for file metadata and validation results, with invalidation triggers on file modification.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort, High payoff\n\n### 5. **Unclear UX Flow Control**\n**Insight:** The step-based workflow creates artificial barriers that may frustrate experienced developers while confusing newcomers.\n**Evidence:** Lines 652-686 show increasingly aggressive guidance messages (\"MANDATORY\", \"STOP!\", \"WAIT!\"), while the required_actions system (lines 340-376) prescribes investigation steps that may not match developer workflows.\n**Impact:** This creates a rigid process that conflicts with natural development patterns, leading to tool abandonment.\n**Recommendation:** Implement a \"quick mode\" that allows experienced developers to bypass steps, while maintaining the guided mode for newcomers.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, Medium payoff\n\n## Quick Wins\n- **Remove duplicate state storage** (lines 195-197 vs 695-705)\n- **Simplify confidence enum** from 7 to 3 levels\n- **Add clear parameter grouping** in schema documentation\n- **Implement basic file caching** for repeated operations\n- **Reduce aggressive guidance language** in step messages\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1 (0-2 weeks)**: Implement simplified configuration tiers and basic caching\n2. **Phase 2 (2-4 weeks)**: Refactor state management to use immutable data structures\n3. **Phase 3 (1-2 months)**: Add workflow customization options (quick vs guided modes)\n4. **Phase 4 (2-3 months)**: Implement intelligent caching with file system watchers\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate**: Create a simplified configuration schema with essential parameters only\n2. **Short-term**: Refactor the confidence system to use 3 levels and remove the \"certain\" bypass\n3. **Medium-term**: Implement a caching layer for file operations to improve performance",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
