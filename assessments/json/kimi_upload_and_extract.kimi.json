    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe `kimi_upload_and_extract` tool is a functional but fragile file-ingestion bridge to Moonshot's Kimi API. While it correctly implements caching and retry logic, it suffers from deep architectural coupling, poor error handling, and UX complexity that will impede scaling. The synchronous retry-with-sleep pattern inside an async context is a critical performance risk, and the lack of file validation or size checks creates predictable failure modes.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. **Synchronous I/O in Async Context**\n**Insight:** The tool uses `asyncio.to_thread` to wrap a blocking `_run` method, but `_run` itself contains blocking retry loops with `time.sleep()` (LINE 147) and synchronous file operations.\n**Evidence:** LINE 134-154 shows a nested `_fetch()` function that calls `time.sleep()` for backoff, blocking the thread pool worker.\n**Impact:** Under load, this will exhaust the default thread pool (typically ~10 workers), causing cascading latency spikes across the entire MCP server.\n**Recommendation:** Replace the retry loop with `asyncio.sleep()` and use aiohttp or httpx for async HTTP calls to Kimi. Consider using tenacity or asyncio-retry for robust async retry patterns.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff for scalability.\n\n### 2. **Missing File Validation & Size Checks**\n**Insight:** The tool accepts any file path without validating existence, size, or MIME type, leading to predictable runtime failures.\n**Evidence:** LINE 67-70 only checks for empty list; no validation occurs before upload attempts.\n**Impact:** Users will experience cryptic errors when files exceed Kimi's 100MB limit or when paths are invalid, creating poor UX and wasted API quota.\n**Recommendation:** Add pre-upload validation: check file existence, size against `KIMI_FILES_MAX_SIZE_MB`, and MIME type whitelist. Provide clear error messages.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; High payoff for UX.\n\n### 3. **Overly Defensive Error Handling**\n**Insight:** The code uses 7 separate try/except blocks with silent failure patterns (LINE 103, 110, 124, 131, 164, 169), masking critical issues.\n**Evidence:** LINE 103-104 silently ignores cache hit recording failures; LINE 164-165 swallows provider errors.\n**Impact:** Debugging becomes extremely difficult as failures are hidden. Observability data becomes unreliable.\n**Recommendation:** Centralize error handling with structured logging. Only catch exceptions you can meaningfully handle; let others propagate with context.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff for maintainability.\n\n### 4. **Cache Implementation Redundancy**\n**Insight:** The file cache computes SHA256 twice (LINE 95 and 121) and instantiates `FileCache()` multiple times per file.\n**Evidence:** LINE 96 and 122 both create new `FileCache()` instances; LINE 95 and 121 duplicate SHA computation.\n**Impact:** Unnecessary CPU and I/O overhead, especially for large files. Violates DRY principle.\n**Recommendation:** Compute SHA once per file and reuse. Consider making `FileCache` a singleton or injecting it as a dependency.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff for performance.\n\n### 5. **Configuration Sprawl**\n**Insight:** Configuration is scattered across 7 different environment variables with no centralized validation or defaults.\n**Evidence:** `KIMI_DEFAULT_MODEL`, `KIMI_API_KEY`, `KIMI_FILES_MAX_SIZE_MB`, `KIMI_FILES_FETCH_RETRIES`, `KIMI_FILES_FETCH_BACKOFF`, `KIMI_FILES_FETCH_INITIAL_DELAY`, `FILECACHE_ENABLED`.\n**Impact:** Configuration drift and documentation debt. New developers struggle to understand required settings.\n**Recommendation:** Create a centralized configuration class using pydantic-settings with clear validation and defaults.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High long-term payoff.\n\n### 6. **Tight Coupling to Kimi Provider**\n**Insight:** The tool is hardcoded to KimiModelProvider, making it impossible to support other file-extraction providers.\n**Evidence:** LINE 73-79 explicitly checks for `KimiModelProvider` and creates new instance if not found.\n**Impact:** Limits future extensibility when other providers offer better pricing or features.\n**Recommendation:** Extract a `FileUploadProvider` interface and use dependency injection. The current provider check is actually a bug - it should use the registry consistently.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff for flexibility.\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Add file existence check before upload: `if not Path(fp).exists(): raise FileNotFoundError(fp)`\n- Add file size validation: `if Path(fp).stat().st_size > max_size: raise ValueError(f\"File too large: {fp}\")`\n- Replace `time.sleep()` with `asyncio.sleep()` in retry loop\n- Cache SHA256",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
