    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe refactor tool presents a well-structured workflow for systematic code analysis, but exhibits significant architectural overengineering that creates complexity risks, performance bottlenecks, and UX friction. While the step-by-step investigation pattern is sound, the implementation suffers from excessive configuration layers, redundant validation, and unclear separation between investigation guidance and actual refactoring recommendations.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. **Architectural Overengineering & Complexity Debt**\n**Insight:** The tool implements an overly generic workflow framework with excessive abstraction layers that add complexity without proportional value.\n**Evidence:** Lines 173-578 contain 400+ lines of inheritance hooks, status mappings, and configuration overrides that could be simplified. The `get_completion_status()`, `get_completion_data_key()`, and similar methods (lines 545-578) represent unnecessary abstraction when a simple state machine would suffice.\n**Impact:** Increases cognitive load for maintainers, slows onboarding, and creates maintenance overhead as the codebase evolves.\n**Recommendation:** Consolidate the 15+ hook methods into 3-4 core lifecycle methods with clear responsibilities.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff in maintainability\n\n### 2. **State Management Fragility**\n**Insight:** The confidence-based workflow relies on string comparisons (\"exploring\", \"incomplete\", \"partial\", \"complete\") that are prone to drift and misinterpretation.\n**Evidence:** Lines 95-104 define confidence levels as strings, while lines 372-376 use these for critical flow control. The `should_skip_expert_analysis()` method (lines 531-536) creates a brittle dependency on exact string matching.\n**Impact:** Risk of workflow failures due to string mismatches, difficulty in extending confidence levels, and unclear state transitions.\n**Recommendation:** Replace string-based confidence with a proper enum or state machine pattern.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff\n\n### 3. **Input Validation Complexity & Security Risk**\n**Insight:** The security validation implementation (lines 474-516) introduces unnecessary complexity and potential failure points through dynamic imports and exception handling.\n**Evidence:** The nested try-except blocks and dynamic imports for `SecureInputValidator` create multiple failure modes. The validation logic spans 40+ lines with unclear error propagation.\n**Impact:** Security vulnerabilities through exception masking, difficult debugging, and maintenance challenges when security requirements change.\n**Recommendation:** Extract security validation into a dedicated, testable module with clear error messages.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff\n\n### 4. **UX Complexity in Investigation Guidance**\n**Insight:** The step guidance system creates overwhelming cognitive load through verbose, imperative instructions that may confuse rather than guide users.\n**Evidence:** Lines 638-676 contain multi-line strings with ALL CAPS instructions, creating a confrontational tone. The guidance repeats the same pattern across different confidence levels with minor variations.\n**Impact:** Poor user experience, increased cognitive load, and potential for users to skip important investigation steps.\n**Recommendation:** Simplify guidance to 2-3 clear bullet points per step, use consistent formatting, and provide examples rather than commands.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; High payoff\n\n### 5. **Redundant Field Mapping & Data Duplication**\n**Insight:** Multiple fields serve overlapping purposes, creating data consistency risks and confusion.\n**Evidence:** `findings` and `hypothesis` (line 526) are mapped to the same value. `files_checked` vs `relevant_files` creates ambiguity about what should be tracked. The `issues_found` field duplicates information that could be derived from findings.\n**Impact:** Data inconsistency risks, unclear data flow, and increased storage/memory usage.\n**Recommendation:** Consolidate overlapping fields and establish clear data ownership boundaries.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff\n\n## Quick Wins\n- **Replace string confidence levels with enum** (lines 95-104, 372-376)\n- **Simplify step guidance messages** by removing ALL CAPS and reducing to 2-3 bullet points\n- **Extract security validation** into a dedicated module with clear error handling\n- **Remove redundant hook methods** by consolidating into 3-4 core lifecycle methods\n- **Add type hints** to the `issues_found` field to prevent runtime errors\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1 (Immediate)**: Implement enum-based confidence system and simplify step guidance\n2. **Phase 2 (Next sprint)**: Extract security validation and consolidate hook methods\n3. **Phase 3 (Next quarter)**: Refactor the entire workflow to use a proper state machine pattern\n4. **Phase 4 (Future)**: Consider whether the generic workflow framework is necessary or if a simpler, refactor-specific implementation would be more maintainable\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate**: Create an enum for confidence levels and update all string comparisons\n2. **This week**: Extract the security validation logic into `src/core/validation/refactor",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
