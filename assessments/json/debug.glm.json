    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe debug tool implements a sophisticated, structured debugging workflow with strong emphasis on systematic investigation and evidence gathering. While its step-by-step approach and confidence tracking are well-designed for complex debugging scenarios, the implementation suffers from architectural fragility, inefficient state management, and over-engineered complexity that could undermine scalability and user experience.\n\n## Strategic Findings\n\n### 1. Fragile State Management Architecture\n**Insight:** The tool maintains extensive investigation state through multiple interconnected data structures without clear persistence or recovery mechanisms.\n**Evidence:** Lines 117-152 define 11 complex state fields (e.g., `files_checked`, `relevant_files`, `hypotheses`). Consolidation logic (lines 322-337) relies on undefined `consolidated_findings` object. State is passed through multiple methods (`prepare_step_data`, `customize_workflow_response`) without clear ownership boundaries.\n**Impact:** State corruption could cause investigation loss during long sessions. Memory usage scales poorly with investigation depth. No recovery mechanism exists if the tool crashes mid-investigation.\n**Recommendation:** Implement a dedicated state management service with persistence layer (e.g., SQLite or Redis). Use immutable data structures for state transitions to prevent corruption.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (improves reliability and scalability).\n\n### 2. Inefficient File Handling and Token Management\n**Insight:** The tool embeds entire file contents in prompts without size limits or smart summarization, risking token exhaustion and performance degradation.\n**Evidence:** Lines 387-396 show full file content embedding via `_prepare_file_content_for_prompt()`. No token counting or content truncation logic exists. Large files could consume thousands of unnecessary tokens.\n**Impact:** Causes API failures when token limits exceeded, especially with large codebases. Increases latency and costs. May truncate critical debugging context.\n**Recommendation:** Implement intelligent content extraction: 1) Token-aware chunking 2) Context-aware summarization 3) Priority-based file selection. Add token budget tracking.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff (improves reliability and cost efficiency).\n\n### 3. Over-Engineered Confidence System\n**Insight:** Seven confidence levels (\"exploring\" to \"certain\") create unnecessary complexity without proportional value.\n**Evidence:** Lines 97-105 define granular confidence tiers. Logic branches in `get_required_actions` (lines 279-320) and `get_step_guidance` (lines 427-487) over-engineer state transitions. \"Certain\" confidence (line 570) requires 100% bug certainty - an unrealistic standard.\n**Impact:** Cognitive overhead for users and developers. Brittle state transitions risk investigation deadlocks. Unrealistic confidence expectations may lead to false conclusions.\n**Recommendation:** Simplify to 3 levels: `exploring`, `investigating`, `concluded`. Remove \"certain\" confidence - always allow expert analysis override.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff (improves usability and maintainability).\n\n### 4. Security Validation Tight Coupling\n**Insight:** Security validation is deeply embedded in core workflow logic, creating brittleness and violating separation of concerns.\n**Evidence:** Lines 496-532 show security validation mixed with state preparation. `SecureInputValidator` import failure (line 497) crashes entire tool. Path normalization (lines 506-515) is tightly coupled with investigation state.\n**Impact:** Security module changes could break debugging workflow. No graceful fallback if security validation unavailable. Difficult to test core functionality independently.\n**Recommendation:** Extract security validation into separate service. Implement decorator pattern for optional validation with fallback logging. Use dependency injection for validator.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; Medium payoff (improves maintainability and testability).\n\n### 5. Missing Error Handling and Recovery\n**Insight:** Critical file operations and external model calls lack robust error handling, risking investigation loss.\n**Evidence:** `prepare_expert_analysis_context` (lines 339-397) has no exception handling for file reads. `_extract_error_context` (lines 416-425) assumes structured findings. No checkpointing for long investigations.\n**Impact:** File read failures could lose investigation progress. External API failures would require restarting entire workflow. No recovery from mid-process crashes.\n**Recommendation:** Implement: 1) Try-catch blocks for all I/O operations 2) Auto-save checkpoints every N steps 3) Graceful degradation when external services unavailable.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; High payoff (improves reliability and user experience).\n\n## Quick Wins\n1. **Add token budget tracking**: Implement token counting before embedding files to prevent API failures\n2. **Simplify confidence messages**: Replace verbose confidence descriptions with clear action prompts\n3. **Add file size limits**: Cap embedded file content at 2KB with truncation warnings\n4. **Implement basic logging**: Add debug logs for state transitions and file operations\n5. **Add recovery checkpointing**: Save state every 3 steps to local cache\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Investigation persistence**: Implement database-backed state storage for session recovery\n2. **Modular architecture**: Split into independent components (state manager, file handler, confidence engine)\n3. **Performance profiling**: Identify and optimize bottlenecks in file processing and state consolidation\n4. **UX simplification**: Create guided workflows for common debugging scenarios (race conditions, memory leaks)\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Address file handling inefficiencies**: Implement token-aware content extraction within 2 sprints\n2. **Add error handling and recovery**: Implement checkpointing and graceful degradation within 1 sprint\n3. **Refactor confidence system**: Simplify to 3 levels and remove \"certain\" confidence threshold immediately\n\nThese changes will significantly improve the tool's reliability, scalability, and maintainability while reducing cognitive overhead for users. The core debugging methodology remains sound but requires architectural hardening to handle real-world complexity.",
