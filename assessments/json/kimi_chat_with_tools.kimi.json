    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe `kimi_chat_with_tools` tool is a monolithic, tightly-coupled orchestrator that mixes LLM orchestration, web-search logic, provider abstraction, and streaming/non-streaming execution paths in a single 400-line file. While it delivers immediate functionality, the design exhibits high cyclomatic complexity, brittle error handling, and ad-hoc configuration management that will impede scaling, testing, and onboarding. The code is functional but not future-proof; strategic refactoring into layered concerns (provider, orchestration, search, streaming) is required to support new models, new search backends, or multi-turn tool loops beyond the current 3-step limit.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Monolithic Architecture & High Coupling\n**Insight:** All responsibilities—provider lookup, message normalization, tool injection, web-search execution, streaming vs. non-streaming branching—live in one class, violating SRP and making unit testing impossible.\n**Evidence:** Lines 68-406 contain nested functions (`_stream_call`, `_extract_tool_calls`, `_run_web_search_backend`) that cannot be imported or mocked independently.\n**Impact:** Any change (new search backend, new provider, new message format) requires editing this file, increasing regression risk.\n**Recommendation:** Extract three layers: (1) `KimiProviderAdapter` (provider-specific calls), (2) `SearchBackendRegistry` (pluggable search), (3) `ChatOrchestrator` (message/tool loop). Keep the tool class as a thin façade.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff—enables parallel development and safe refactors.\n\n### 2. Ad-Hoc Configuration & Environment Sprawl\n**Insight:** Twelve distinct environment variables (`KIMI_DEFAULT_MODEL`, `KIMI_ENABLE_INTERNET_TOOL`, `SEARCH_BACKEND`, etc.) are read inline without validation or documentation, leading to silent misconfiguration.\n**Evidence:** Lines 29, 72-73, 135-138, 266, 329-334.\n**Impact:** Operators must hunt through code to discover tunables; typos cause silent fallbacks.\n**Recommendation:** Introduce a single `KimiConfig` Pydantic model loaded at startup with clear defaults and validation; inject into the tool via constructor.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff—reduces support tickets and onboarding friction.\n\n### 3. Brittle Tool-Loop & Streaming Incompatibility\n**Insight:** The 3-step tool loop (lines 314-406) is hard-coded and disabled entirely when streaming is requested with web-search (lines 184-185), eliminating real-time tool use.\n**Evidence:** Line 314 `for _ in range(3):` and line 185 `stream_flag = False`.\n**Impact:** Users cannot observe incremental tool progress; future multi-step agents will hit the depth wall.\n**Recommendation:** Implement async streaming loop with incremental tool-call handling; move loop depth to configuration.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort; High payoff—unlocks interactive agents and future UX improvements.\n\n### 4. Error Handling & Observability Gaps\n**Insight:** Broad `except Exception: pass` (lines 93-94, 149-150, 211, 231, 358-359, 393-397) swallows diagnostics; timeouts are coarse (180-300 s) and non-configurable per call.\n**Evidence:** Line 93, 149, 393.\n**Impact:** Production incidents become black boxes; users cannot distinguish network, auth, or quota errors.\n**Recommendation:** Adopt structured logging (JSON) with correlation IDs; propagate provider error codes; expose per-call timeout override in schema.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low-Medium effort; High payoff—reduces MTTR and improves UX.\n\n### 5. Security & Secrets Exposure\n**Insight:** API keys (`KIMI_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `BING_SEARCH_API_KEY`) are read directly from `os.getenv` and used in inline HTTP calls without rotation or masking.\n**Evidence:** Lines 77-79, 270-274, 284-289.\n**Impact:** Keys may leak in stack traces or logs; no story for key rotation or per-user keys.\n**Recommendation:** Centralize secrets in a `SecretsManager` abstraction (env, AWS SM, Vault) with redaction in logs; support per-request key injection for multi-tenant deployments.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff—compliance readiness and safer SaaS.\n\n### 6. Over-Engineered String Coercion\n**Insight:** Extensive type-coercion logic (lines 97-133, 153-176) attempts to accept strings, dicts, lists, and JSON strings for `tools`, `tool_choice`, and `messages`, increasing complexity and hiding schema violations.\n**Evidence:** Lines 100-104, 106-122, 153",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
