    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe codereview tool demonstrates solid architectural foundations with clear separation of concerns and systematic workflow management. However, it exhibits significant complexity bloat, over-engineering patterns, and UX friction that could impede adoption and long-term maintainability. The tool's strength lies in its structured approach to code review, but this is undermined by excessive configuration options, convoluted validation logic, and unclear user guidance.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. **Configuration Overload & UX Complexity**\n**Insight:** The tool presents an overwhelming array of configuration options that create decision paralysis rather than enabling focused reviews.\n**Evidence:** Lines 157-164 expose 4 distinct review types, optional focus areas, custom standards, and severity filters. The `get_input_schema()` method (lines 238-325) generates complex schemas with 17+ field overrides.\n**Impact:** Users face cognitive overload when initiating reviews, leading to inconsistent usage patterns and abandoned reviews.\n**Recommendation:** Implement a progressive disclosure pattern - start with essential parameters (file path) and offer advanced configuration through optional flags or interactive prompts.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff\n\n### 2. **Over-Engineered Validation Layer**\n**Insight:** The security validation implementation (lines 478-515) introduces unnecessary complexity through dynamic imports and redundant path normalization.\n**Evidence:** The `prepare_step_data()` method contains 37 lines of defensive validation that duplicates pathlib operations and implements custom image validation logic.\n**Impact:** Performance overhead, increased failure surface area, and maintenance burden for security features that may not be actively used.\n**Recommendation:** Extract security validation to a dedicated, optional middleware layer that can be enabled/disabled via configuration.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, Medium payoff\n\n### 3. **State Management Anti-Patterns**\n**Insight:** The tool maintains state through instance variables (`initial_request`, `review_config`) that create hidden dependencies and potential race conditions.\n**Evidence:** Lines 191-192 declare instance variables that are set in `customize_workflow_response()` (lines 683-693) and used across multiple method calls.\n**Impact:** Difficult to test, potential for state leakage between reviews, and unclear data flow.\n**Recommendation:** Refactor to use explicit context objects passed through method parameters, eliminating hidden state.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort, High payoff\n\n### 4. **Duplicated Schema Definitions**\n**Insight:** Field descriptions and validation rules are duplicated between the Pydantic model and schema builder.\n**Evidence:** `CODEREVIEW_WORKFLOW_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS` (lines 36-120) mirrors field definitions in `CodeReviewRequest` (lines 123-176), and both are used in `get_input_schema()`.\n**Impact:** Maintenance overhead and risk of drift between definitions.\n**Recommendation:** Generate schema directly from Pydantic model metadata using introspection.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, Medium payoff\n\n### 5. **Inconsistent Confidence Handling**\n**Insight:** The confidence system creates confusion with 7 levels including ambiguous distinctions like \"very_high\" vs \"almost_certain\".\n**Evidence:** Lines 98-107 define confidence levels with unclear practical differences, while `should_skip_expert_analysis()` (lines 531-535) only checks for \"certain\".\n**Impact:** Users cannot effectively gauge when reviews are complete, leading to either premature termination or excessive iterations.\n**Recommendation:** Simplify to 4 levels: exploring, low, medium, high (complete).\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort, High payoff\n\n### 6. **Tight Coupling to File System**\n**Insight:** The tool assumes direct file system access, limiting its utility in containerized or remote development environments.\n**Evidence:** Lines 485-486 hardcode repository root resolution, and all file operations assume local paths.\n**Impact:** Reduced flexibility for modern deployment patterns and CI/CD integration.\n**Recommendation:** Introduce a file system abstraction layer supporting multiple backends (local, GitHub API, S3, etc.).\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** High effort, Medium payoff\n\n## Quick Wins\n- **Remove redundant validation**: Eliminate duplicate path normalization in `prepare_step_data()`\n- **Simplify confidence levels**: Reduce from 7 to 4 levels with clear criteria\n- **Consolidate field descriptions**: Use Pydantic field metadata for schema generation\n- **Add sensible defaults**: Provide default review_type=\"quick\" for faster onboarding\n- **Improve error messages**: Replace generic ValueError with specific, actionable feedback\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Modular Architecture**: Split into core workflow engine and review-specific plugins\n2. **Remote Repository Support**: Add GitHub/GitLab integration for PR reviews\n3. **Caching Layer**: Implement intelligent caching for repeated analyses\n4. **Metrics Dashboard**: Track review quality metrics and user engagement\n5. **Plugin System**: Allow custom review rules and integrations\n\n## Next Steps\n",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
