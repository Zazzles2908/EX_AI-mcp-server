    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe precommit tool implementation exhibits significant overengineering with excessive complexity, verbose descriptions, and tight coupling to external dependencies. While designed for comprehensive pre-commit validation, its 744-line monolithic structure with numerous method overrides creates maintainability risks and potential performance bottlenecks. The tool's security validation is fragile due to optional enforcement and complex dependencies, while its user interface suffers from overwhelming verbosity that could hinder adoption.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Overengineered Workflow Architecture\n**Insight**: The tool implements excessive abstractions and customizations that add complexity without proportional benefits.\n**Evidence**: The PrecommitTool class (lines 183-744) contains 744 lines with 20+ method overrides, complex field descriptions (lines 35-122), and extensive customization of the base workflow tool.\n**Impact**: High cognitive load for maintenance, increased bug risk, and slower onboarding for new developers.\n**Recommendation**: Extract common patterns into reusable components and reduce custom overrides by at least 50%.\n**Effort vs. Benefit**: Medium effort; High payoff (significantly improved maintainability and reduced technical debt).\n\n### 2. Fragile Security Validation Implementation\n**Insight**: Security validation is optional with complex dependencies, creating potential security gaps.\n**Evidence**: Lines 487-523 show try-except blocks for optional security imports and validation, with potential for silent failures.\n**Impact**: Inconsistent security posture and potential vulnerabilities when validation is skipped or fails.\n**Recommendation**: Make security validation mandatory and simplify implementation by reducing dependencies.\n**Effort vs. Benefit**: Low effort; High payoff (improved security reliability and consistency).\n\n### 3. Inefficient Git Operations and File Processing\n**Insight**: The tool likely performs redundant git operations without caching, impacting performance.\n**Evidence**: Lines 344-350 specify multiple git operations per step, with no apparent caching mechanism.\n**Impact**: Poor validation performance for large repositories, potentially discouraging tool usage.\n**Recommendation**: Implement caching for git repository information and file analysis results.\n**Effort vs. Benefit**: Medium effort; Medium payoff (improved user experience and validation speed).\n\n### 4. Excessive Verbosity in User Interface\n**Insight**: Extremely verbose descriptions and messages overwhelm users and reduce usability.\n**Evidence**: Field descriptions (lines 36-48) contain 100+ character descriptions, and the tool description (lines 202-220) is overly detailed.\n**Impact**: Reduced tool adoption due to complexity and poor user experience.\n**Recommendation**: Condense all descriptions by 40-50% while maintaining clarity and essential information.\n**Effort vs. Benefit**: Low effort; Medium payoff (improved user experience and adoption).\n\n### 5. Tight Coupling with External Dependencies\n**Insight**: Direct imports and usage of external modules (lines 26-27, 487-523) create fragility.\n**Evidence**: Hardcoded imports from config, systemprompts, and validation modules without abstraction layers.\n**Impact**: Reduced testability, deployment flexibility, and increased maintenance burden.\n**Recommendation**: Implement dependency injection and interfaces for all external dependencies.\n**Effort vs. Benefit**: High effort; High payoff (improved testability, maintainability, and flexibility).\n\n## Quick Wins\n1. **Simplify Field Descriptions**: Condense PRECOMMIT_WORKFLOW_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS to be more concise while preserving clarity.\n2. **Improve Error Handling**: Add specific error messages for security validation failures instead of generic exceptions.\n3. **Replace Hardcoded Status Mappings**: Convert status mappings (lines 709-714) to use enums or constants.\n4. **Extract Large Methods**: Break down methods like get_precommit_step_guidance (lines 633-688) into smaller, focused functions.\n5. **Add Input Validation**: Strengthen validation for path and file inputs to prevent security issues.\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Microservice Refactoring**: Split the monolithic tool into focused services for git analysis, security validation, and expert analysis.\n2. **Implement Comprehensive Caching**: Develop a caching strategy for git operations, file analysis, and validation results.\n3. **Enhance Test Coverage**: Improve testability by reducing dependencies and implementing proper interfaces.\n4. **Modernize Architecture**: Consider adopting a more modular design pattern with clear separation of concerns.\n5. **Performance Optimization Profile**: Create performance benchmarks and optimization targets for large repositories.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate Refactoring**: Begin with simplifying field descriptions and improving error handling (low effort, quick wins).\n2. **Security Enhancement**: Make security validation mandatory and simplify its implementation.\n3. **Performance Assessment**: Profile the tool with large repositories to identify and address performance bottlenecks.\n4. **Dependency Injection**: Plan and implement a dependency injection framework to reduce coupling.\n5. **User Experience Review**: Conduct usability testing to identify and address UX pain points.",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
