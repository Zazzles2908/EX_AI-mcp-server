    "raw_analysis": "## Executive Overview\nThe planner tool is a well-structured workflow implementation that successfully encapsulates complex planning logic within a clean architecture. While it demonstrates strong separation of concerns and maintains consistency with the broader workflow system, several UX complexity risks and architectural inefficiencies emerge from its over-engineered branching model and verbose response patterns that could hinder long-term maintainability and user adoption.\n\n## Strategic Findings (Ordered by Impact)\n\n### 1. Over-Engineered Branching Architecture\n**Insight:** The branching system (`branches` dict, branch_id tracking, complex metadata) adds significant complexity without clear value proposition for the primary use case.\n**Evidence:** Lines 129, 444-448, 455-466 show elaborate branch tracking infrastructure that stores step data per branch but never appears to be used for actual planning logic or user value.\n**Impact:** Increases cognitive load for maintainers, adds untested code paths, and creates potential for data inconsistency between branches and main history.\n**Recommendation:** Simplify to a single planning path with revision capability; remove branching complexity unless specific multi-scenario planning requirements emerge.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; High payoff in reduced complexity and improved reliability.\n\n### 2. Response Verbosity and UX Complexity\n**Insight:** Response payloads contain excessive metadata and nested structures that create UX complexity without proportional value.\n**Evidence:** Lines 344-369, 440-505 show deeply nested response structures with redundant fields (`step_history_length` appears twice), verbose status messages, and complex presentation guidelines.\n**Impact:** API consumers must parse unnecessarily complex responses; increases payload size and processing overhead; creates maintenance burden for response format changes.\n**Recommendation:** Flatten response structure, eliminate redundant fields, and provide a clean separation between core planning data and presentation metadata.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; High payoff in API usability and client implementation simplicity.\n\n### 3. Inconsistent State Management\n**Insight:** The tool maintains parallel state tracking through both workflow history and custom branch storage, creating potential for state drift.\n**Evidence:** Lines 342-343 calculate step counts from `work_history` while simultaneously maintaining separate `branches` dictionary; no synchronization mechanism evident.\n**Impact:** Risk of inconsistent state reporting; debugging complexity increases; potential for lost planning context during long sessions.\n**Recommendation:** Consolidate state management to use workflow history exclusively; eliminate custom branch storage unless specifically required.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; Medium payoff in reliability and debugging simplicity.\n\n### 4. Deep Thinking Pause Anti-Pattern\n**Insight:** The forced \"deep thinking\" pauses (lines 387-426) create artificial UX friction that may frustrate users rather than enhance planning quality.\n**Evidence:** Hard-coded pause logic with mandatory reflection periods based on arbitrary step thresholds (≥5 steps, steps 1-3).\n**Impact:** Disrupts natural planning flow; creates inconsistent user experience; assumes uniform planning complexity regardless of actual task nature.\n**Recommendation:** Make reflection prompts optional configuration rather than mandatory pauses; allow users to control pacing based on their needs.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Low effort; High payoff in user experience consistency.\n\n### 5. Configuration Over-Specification\n**Insight:** The tool excludes numerous fields through explicit exclusion lists, suggesting the base workflow model may be over-generalized for planning needs.\n**Evidence:** Lines 77-97, 222-239 maintain extensive exclusion lists for fields that shouldn't apply to planning.\n**Impact:** Maintenance burden increases as base model evolves; risk of breaking changes when exclusions become outdated.\n**Recommendation:** Create a dedicated planning model that inherits only necessary fields rather than excluding from a general workflow model.\n**Effort vs. Benefit:** Medium effort; Medium payoff in architectural clarity and reduced maintenance overhead.\n\n## Quick Wins\n- Remove redundant `step_history_length` field from response (appears in both status and metadata)\n- Simplify branch tracking to use workflow history instead of separate `branches` dict\n- Reduce response nesting by flattening metadata structure\n- Make deep thinking pauses configurable rather than mandatory\n- Eliminate unused `store_initial_issue` and `get_initial_request` methods (lines 534-543)\n\n## Long-Term Roadmap Suggestions\n1. **Phase 1 (Immediate)**: Simplify branching architecture and reduce response complexity\n2. **Phase 2 (Short-term)**: Extract planning-specific model from workflow base to eliminate exclusion anti-pattern\n3. **Phase 3 (Medium-term)**: Implement planning templates for common scenarios to reduce user cognitive load\n4. **Phase 4 (Long-term)**: Consider migration to state machine pattern for more explicit planning state management\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Immediate**: Remove branching complexity and redundant response fields (1-2 days)\n2. **Short-term**: Refactor to dedicated planning model, eliminating exclusion lists (3-5 days)\n3. **Medium-term**: User testing to validate whether deep thinking pauses provide actual value or should be optional",

  "next_steps": "ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. You MUST now summarize and present ALL analysis findings organized by strategic impact (Critical → High → Medium → Low), specific architectural insights with code references, and exact recommendations for improvement. Clearly prioritize the top 3 strategic opportunities that need immediate attention. Provide concrete, actionable guidance for each finding—make it easy for a developer to understand exactly what strategic improvements to implement and how to approach them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Analysis from an assistant model has been provided above. You MUST thoughtfully evaluate and validate the expert insights rather than treating them as definitive conclusions. Cross-reference the expert analysis with your own systematic investigation, verify that architectural recommendations are appropriate for this codebase's scale and context, and ensure suggested improvements align with the project's goals and constraints. Present a comprehensive synthesis that combines your detailed analysis with validated expert perspectives, clearly distinguishing between patterns you've independently identified and additional strategic insights from expert validation.",
