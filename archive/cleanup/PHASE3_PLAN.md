# Phase 3: Archive-first Cleanup Plan

This plan follows the Cleanup Prompt. All removals are staged into `archive/` first, and can be restored.

## Guiding principles
- Backwards compatible: no schema changes
- Archive-first: do not delete code immediately
- Reversible: provide a restore manifest and script
- Small, safe batches

## Archive directories
- `archive/consensus_legacy/`
- `archive/assessment_legacy/`
- `archive/schemas_legacy/`
- `archive/templates_legacy/`
- `archive/config_legacy/`
- `archive/error_legacy/`
- `archive/tools_legacy/`
- `archive/monitoring_legacy/`

## Candidates to archive (first pass)
- Consensus legacy duplicates (older variants of consensus schema/templates)
- Assessment infrastructure superseded by agentic expert-analysis path
- Duplicated schema builders and prompt templates
- Redundant error utilities replaced by ResilientErrorHandler
- Unused/verbose tool description duplication and dead branches

## Process per batch
1) Dry-run move (list) with cleanup script
2) Archive files into `archive/<category>/`
3) Commit with message `chore(cleanup): archive <batch_name>`
4) Optional: after validation, run delete mode to remove archived files

## Restore process
- Use the manifest entries for a batch to restore files back to their original paths

## Next steps
- Author the manifest JSON
- Implement the cleanup script with dry-run, archive, delete, and restore modes
- Prepare the initial batch (consensus legacy and assessment infra)


## Initial batches to populate

- consensus_legacy:
  - assessments/json/*consensus.json error snapshots related to legacy required findings
- assessment_legacy:
  - assessments/json/*.kimi.json and *.glm.json artifacts from earlier analysis runs
- schemas_templates:
  - any duplicated/obsolete schema builders or templates once identified


## Final plan and task tree (derived from 5 docs)

- Consensus legacy cleanup
  - [x] Inventory errors snapshots under assessments/json/*consensus.json
  - [x] Add to manifest (consensus_legacy)
  - [ ] Archive and optionally delete originals after backup
- Assessment infra cleanup
  - [x] Inventory *.kimi.json and *.glm.json under assessments/json
  - [x] Add to manifest (assessment_legacy)
  - [ ] Archive and optionally delete originals after backup
- Schemas/templates cleanup
  - [ ] Inventory duplicated/obsolete schema builders and templates
  - [ ] Add to manifest (schemas_templates)
  - [ ] Archive and optionally delete originals after backup
- Error/config legacy cleanup
  - [ ] Identify and add obsolete error utilities and config entries replaced by flags
  - [ ] Add to manifest (error_legacy, config_legacy)
  - [ ] Archive and optionally delete originals after backup
- Monitoring/log artifacts cleanup
  - [x] Inventory log artifacts
  - [x] Add to manifest (monitoring_legacy)
  - [ ] Archive and optionally delete originals after backup

Notes:
- Feature flags remain default OFF; no schema/API changes
- Archive-first process, restore supported per batch


## Execution results (current run)

- Commands executed
  - `python scripts/cleanup_phase3.py dry-run`
  - `python scripts/cleanup_phase3.py archive`

- Batch outcomes
  - consensus_legacy: Present=0, Missing=20
    - Rationale: these files had already been archived earlier (now live under `archive/consensus_legacy/`), so the script correctly marked them as missing at their old locations
  - assessment_legacy: Present=40, Missing=0 → archived to `archive/assessment_legacy/`
  - schemas_templates: Present=0, Missing=0 (no items populated yet)
  - monitoring_legacy: Present=8, Missing=0 → archived to `archive/monitoring_legacy/`

- Sample archive logs (abbrev.)
  - `[ARCHIVE 21/40] assessments/json/activity.glm.json -> archive/assessment_legacy/assessments/json/activity.glm.json`
  - `[ARCHIVE 8/8] logs/ws_shim.log -> archive/monitoring_legacy/logs/ws_shim.log`

- Deletion step: not executed yet (archive-only run)

## Current checklist status

- Consensus legacy cleanup
  - [x] Inventory errors snapshots under assessments/json/*consensus.json
  - [x] Add to manifest (consensus_legacy)
  - [x] Archived previously (script now reports Missing at old paths)
  - [ ] Optional: run delete for any lingering originals (none expected)
- Assessment infra cleanup
  - [x] Inventory *.kimi.json and *.glm.json under assessments/json
  - [x] Add to manifest (assessment_legacy)
  - [x] Archived to `archive/assessment_legacy/`
  - [ ] Optional: run `archive --delete` to remove originals
- Schemas/templates cleanup
  - [ ] Inventory duplicated/obsolete schema builders and templates
  - [ ] Add to manifest (schemas_templates)
  - [ ] Archive and optionally delete originals after backup
- Error/config legacy cleanup
  - [ ] Identify and add obsolete error utilities and config entries replaced by flags
  - [ ] Add to manifest (error_legacy, config_legacy)
  - [ ] Archive and optionally delete originals after backup
- Monitoring/log artifacts cleanup
  - [x] Inventory log artifacts
  - [x] Add to manifest (monitoring_legacy)
  - [x] Archived to `archive/monitoring_legacy/`
  - [ ] Optional: run `archive --delete` to remove originals

## Restore validation plan

- Run: `python scripts/cleanup_phase3.py restore --batch consensus_legacy`
  - Verify files restored to original locations
  - Re-archive or remove restored samples after validation

## Rollback and notes

- Archive-first mapping is reversible per batch
- No schema/API changes; all feature flags remain default OFF
- The manifest retains consensus_legacy entries to allow restore, even though originals are absent at old paths


## Post-archive deletion (executed)

- Deleted originals for archived batches:
  - assessment_legacy: removed 40 files from assessments/json/*.kimi.json and *.glm.json
  - monitoring_legacy: removed 8 files from logs/*
- consensus_legacy: unchanged (already archived earlier; originals absent at old paths)

## Restore note

- Manifest retains entries for consensus_legacy and other batches; use:
  - `python scripts/cleanup_phase3.py restore --batch consensus_legacy`
- After restore validation, re-archive or delete restored samples to maintain consistency


## Monitoring logs note (Windows)

- Some logs may be immediately re-created by the running server/shim after deletion (e.g., mcp_activity.log, mcp_server.log, ws_daemon.health.json, ws_shim.log)
- To fully remove: stop the processes, then re-run `python scripts/cleanup_phase3.py archive --delete`
- The script now summarizes deletions with a "Deferred(Locked)" count to flag these cases
