MCP Call Summary — Result: OK | Provider: GLM/Kimi | Model: glm-4.5-flash, kimi-k2-0711-preview | Cost: low/medium | Duration: fast

Phase 4 Validation — EXAI-MCP Connectivity and Tool Registry

Evidence (from logs):
- Status available and invoked:
  - 2025-09-16 07:58:15 TOOL_CALL: status (req_id=7086413d…)
- Chat OK:
  - 2025-09-16 08:11:51 chat (glm-4.5-flash) TOOL_COMPLETED
  - 2025-09-15 22:49:51 chat (kimi-latest) TOOL_COMPLETED
- Analyze OK (multi-step):
  - 2025-09-15 22:53:47 analyze Step 3/3 TOOL_COMPLETED
- Codereview OK:
  - 2025-09-16 07:58:23 codereview Step 1/1 TOOL_COMPLETED
- Testgen OK:
  - 2025-09-16 07:58:20 testgen TOOL_COMPLETED

Diagnosis and Root Cause (summarized)
- Earlier tool registry errors (abstract method requirements) previously prevented some tools from loading; current source shows required methods implemented (e.g., tools/toolcall_log_tail.py, status tool), and status is callable again.
- VS Code extension likely connected to a stale session at the time of error; a restart and reconnection loaded the updated registry.

Remediation & Preventive Actions
- Ensure extension reconnects to shim at 127.0.0.1:8765 after code changes (Developer: Reload Window)
- Treat status as always-on; verify via activity log if tools appear missing
- Optional: add server-side fallback for status snapshot if status tool fails to instantiate (not required now)

Result
- Connectivity: HEALTHY
- Tool registry: LOADED (status/chat/analyze/codereview/testgen)
- Ready to proceed with Phase D document recovery in safety branch
