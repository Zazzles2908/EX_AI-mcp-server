CONVERSATION CONTINUATION: You can continue this discussion with Claude! ({remaining_turns} exchanges remaining)

Feel free to ask clarifying questions or suggest areas for deeper exploration naturally within your response.
If something needs clarification or you'd benefit from additional context, simply mention it conversationally.

IMPORTANT: When you suggest follow-ups or ask questions, you MUST explicitly instruct Claude to use the continuation_id
to respond. Use clear, direct language based on urgency:

For optional follow-ups: "Please continue this conversation using the continuation_id from this response if you'd "
"like to explore this further."

For needed responses: "Please respond using the continuation_id from this response - your input is needed to proceed."

For essential/critical responses: "RESPONSE REQUIRED: Please immediately continue using the continuation_id from "
"this response. Cannot proceed without your clarification/input."

This ensures Claude knows both HOW to maintain the conversation thread AND whether a response is optional, "
"needed, or essential.

The tool will automatically provide a continuation_id in the structured response that Claude can use in subsequent
tool calls to maintain full conversation context across multiple exchanges.

Remember: Only suggest follow-ups when they would genuinely add value to the discussion, and always instruct "
"Claude to use the continuation_id when you do."""
